"Kansas is an underrated pickup opportunity... Pat Roberts will be 84 and he may choose to retire so this could be an open seat... if he doesn't it's also good because he's not exactly all that popular either....  

you couple that with the brownback negative halo effect and a surprising amount of dems voted in this cycle and there's a decent chance this seat flips....  

Michigan is also a bit of underrated defense here... although it's highly correlated with how Michigan votes at the top of the ticket...  Stabenow won easily but what hasn't been mentioned a lot was that she underperformed the polls by about 6%... if there was a stronger republican candidate it may have flipped...  I don't think it does but if Trump wins re-election you can bet that this would add on to a potentially bad night....   "
"how can i point to their argument without using pronouns?  it's their argument.. so i need to use words like:  

""you're saying""  
""your subsequent comments""  

how else could i address it?  "
"i did.. i see the subsequent comments... and thats why im asking him to revise because hes drawing his own conclusions from the fbi investigation....  

if you think differently then you tell me what he meant then...  "
"i literally quoted it in my first reply...  

here one more time...  

>Clinton also deleted tens of thousands of emails after they were under subpoena"
"youre saying that clinton did it herself... that obviously did not happen...  

through your subsequent comments youre implying that she also directed after it was under subpeona...  that also did not happen...  

so please revise or retract the statement... it is inaccurate as it stands..."
"so why do you care?  i'm curious why ppl are so aggressively pushing her view on things... i find it odd. "
"that's what i don't get... if you have the opportunity to block a shot.. you the block shot...  what's the defense supposed to do?  prevent a shot from going in....  

you're saying the alternative is to defend the shot... what the hell does that mean?  the goal of defense is to make the offense into a difficult shot... it doesn't get more difficult to score than on a blocked shot... 

you're also saying these guys are forgoing rebounds for shot blocks yet the guys leading the league in blocks also lead the league in rebounds....   

swatting it out of bounds is a different concept and not related...  i agree alot of times that's unnecessary but blocking it altogether is better than saying... 'you know what it would be greedy of me to block this shot... i'll just let it go over my outreached hands and let's see if it goes in...'   

i mean it's hard to get in the head of a 7 ft center... but seriously nobody's thinking that...  

if you have an example i'd love to see it.... "
"i'm just confused on how one would hunt for blocks... a block is the hardest thing on defense to record... that was true during any era....  

what does that even look like?  i'm gonna contest as many shots as possible and try to block as many shots as i can....  that sounds like a pretty good on defense is it not?  

it's not negative... it just sounds silly to me... "
"what does blockhunting even mean?  is protecting the basket and not contesting something a center should not do?  youre saying theres something else more worthwhile than trying to prevent a basket from being made?  like fouling or just not going up at all? 

thats worth more to you?"
"You can call it what you want...  but it's the exact reason why these fringe movements have always been fringe...  

It's one thing to ask or demand or scream for what you want... It's another thing entirely to convince ppl how you're gonna get there...  

In the adult world... if you're acting in good faith... if you want something done... you work with ppl by building a plan together.. and then also invite feedback and incorporate changes.. that's how the ACA was built.. that's how any major piece of legislation gets built...  

Why aren't you demanding that?  Is it more important to get what you want than how to get there?   

I want to end homelessness and hunger... I will fix it by giving away free food and guarantee homes to everyone in the US... Are you voting for that just based off of those two sentences?  I sure hope not..   "
"that's the exact kind of mentality that is so toxic...  it's a large part of the problem in politics... so many ppl think they have the right solutions that only exist in some imaginary world where they get to choose how everyone lives..   

in this world... you work together.. and it might amaze you when you make this discovery.... but the ppl who disagree with you might actually have good reasons to...  "
"With trump winning a lot of assumptions about who and what makes a president should be questioned.... I mean we can't throw it all out but someone who's 'just' been a House member is probably the least concerning question facing a candidate....  

And that's probably because a higher office was needed to gain national name recognition... that's something Beto to an extent has already achieved..  "
"well it's important to remember that while politics is important... it doesn't make up of all our identity... ppl in the bubble tend to forget that and that works both ways... from fox to cnn to even this sub...  

just giving positive exposure can eventually turn some folks... that's why you see dems do a lot better in denser urban areas... because they get exposed to a lot of folks and they have to work with a lot of different types of ppl....  

you're probably their only exposure to 'the other side'... so if you can subvert expectations a bit it's possible to gain traction...  

so trying to avoid politics or rather steer something that the whole family can enjoy not only can have them question their bubble but you'll have more positive experiences on the whole rather than interacting constantly on wedge issues... "
"just don't put politics or the news on and try to avoid politics altogether in discussions and actively try to steer away from it...  "
"that is absolutely absurd... blockhunting was definitely NOT a thing...  

its very simple... ppl shoot more 3s now and centers have to cover way more area than they did before...  "
"it's because the ppl in charge (Cuomo and past governors)... refuse to enact a plan... 

the plan is going to cause a lot of pain.. money and line closures during weekends... but the more we wait the more painful it gets...   

it needs to get done now... "
"no medicare for all doesn't trigger me....  the fact that you think your answer was an answer to my question kind of does....   "
"oh shes doing that now?  wow... amazing... tell me what shes done..."
"and this is one of those comments that doesnt want to address anything that was said but hope ppl agree with what they think because they are so insecure with their own opinion....  

what did your comment add again? "
"salon's right wing?  

i live a couple miles from her district... and i liked that she won but the amount of coverage she is getting is gonna do more harm than good... "
"i wasn't planning to see this in the theaters but that was a pretty impressive trailer...  can't wait."
"holy shit... will the headlines stop about her?  she hasn't done a thing yet...  "
"oh iowa.... the state with a whopping four districts?  

Here read and listen to these on 538....  https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-gerrymandering-project/

when you're done we can discuss when you're less outraged over nothing....   "
"and what ohio republicans have done are no different than what's been happening in every state since basically the inception of this country...   

it's not deflection .... it's reality... and look if you read what i wrote... i'm not deflecting.. yes it's an issue and yes we should bring it back from wholely unreasonable maps to somewhat reasonable ones...  

but they will always be partisan.... there will always be disputes on those lines.... it's not like this generation of folks just discovered a great injustice in our political system... it's been pretty ridiculous for ages.. and there's good reasons on why that is the case which i outlined....   

it's folks like you who would rather be outraged instead of educating themselves on the issue that's going to torpedo the cause... it just leads to band-aids instead of holistic reform... "
"well that's what i'm saying is wrong... teaching effectively is more than reading a lesson plan....  i mean the best kicking coach in football for years was a guy who had no legs.... 

obviously he can't actually kick fgs or punt a football but doing and teaching are completely separate domains...  teaching is not filled with folks who can't cut it... it is filled with folks who want to actually teach... and some are bad and some are good just like those folks who choose to go into other careers...  

and yea sure.. some could be seen as flameouts too... but you're basically trading one skill and leveraging it for another related skill ...  just like it'd be hard to take masters in their field to try and teach ppl effectively...  yea not as hard but i'm taking popovich as my coach over lebron james..  "
"well what i'm saying is that teaching is an actual skill.... and there's probably some talent involved also....  

anyone can present knowledge or regurgitate it... just like anyone can string a couple of notes on a guitar ...  or dribble a basketball... ppl seem to conflate effective do'ers vs average teachers... when really you should be comparing effective ppl in both domains...  

just because you can't dunk a basketball or play like jimi hendrix or eric clapton doesn't mean you're not capable or have less credibility to teach someone how to play... that's a conclusion a lot of ppl seem to get from that popular saying...  


"
"the saying also works the other way... being able to teach someone else to do something effectively and actually doing something effectively are two different skills... it's very hard for folks to be good at both... "
"why would you automatically draw that conclusion?  could it also be that ohio is actually pretty red and that its hard to draw lines favorable to democrats?  most ppl goto the polls based on the top of the ticket...  

theres a very poor understanding of gerrymandering in general... and good solutions wont come until there is a better understanding... this article gives a poor understanding and it results in the comments..."
"i didn't actually mean you... i meant 'you' as in ppl in general...   

there is a difference but most ppl don't know or even acknowledge it because it sounds the same in conversation... I've had plenty of conversations who think these are causes exclusively owned by the Progressive movement... when it's not.."
"well these are values that are actively fought by the democratic party as a whole.... when you say it's 'progressive' you're trying to conflate it with the big P word...  

it happens all the time... and it sucks... these are common sense type of ideals and it's not just owned by a small portion of the party.... it's basically all of the party and even some moderate republicans as well... "
"since when did 'progressives' own initiatives like criminal justice reform? "
"sure i get that.... but just because you get more votes doesn't mean you deserve more seats unless you divide each district by population evenly.... even PA had court drawn maps and they still won the vote but still have less seats....  

a lot of folks have no idea what gerrymandering is and why it's actually a problem... it's not just because republicans draw unfavorable lines... the downvotes signify that.. and these types of articles magnify it....   "
"just like anything you spend moneyon you should have meaningful reasons to be taking trips...

"why are you asking me to look it up if you're making the accusation?  you're making an accusation without looking the law up yourself?  

really?  

ultimately if the ballots are valid.... it means the handling of them aren't relevant...  you have no proof that the ballots aren't valid.... the person you're citing didn't show any proof that they weren't valid...   

and yet here we are...  so i ask again... what proof do you have that the ballots are illegal?"
"what's confusing about 'what proof do you have that the ballots are illegal'?  

if the ballots are valid... they should be counted.. it will be reviewed... and there will be a recount... and hopefully an audit... that's literally end of story so i don't know what this whole concern trolling is about the handling....  

there are multiple ways ballots are secured in transit and multiple detection mechanisms to prove they were not tampered with or replaced.... so i'm not sure where you're citing at which point 'chain of custody' was broken...  what do you think 'chain of custody' means or are you parroting what other ppl are saying?"
"what proof do you have that they are illegal? do you see broken seals? illegitimate serial numbers?  "
"Kansas absolutely needs to be mentioned... Pat Roberts will be 84 in 2020 and on top of it hes not exactly all that popular....  my estimates is that this is an open or somewhat vulnerable seat...  

Kansas just voted in a Dem governor and gains in the house....  Brownback has tainted the GOP all around there and we can absolutely take this seat with the right candidate...  

And yes... even in a presidential election year... Kansas can absolutely split their ticket....
"
"Its solely because democrats do what they always do... they focus on sexy names and charm and hardly pay attention to anything else...  

beto/gillum/abrams were the rockstars and they all lost... hence disappointing..."
"How do you compromise with a man who hasnt shown any effort to compromise?  

Im curious.. maybe im misinformed but please let me know what steps hes taken to bring the country together... theres plenty of evidence to the opposite..."
"To show that the House is making the effort to protect the investigation and the Senate or even the President are not..."
"if she comes out the block with rejection... then a narrative of an obstructionist house is more credible...  

she's offering bipartisanship knowing that it will never happen because it's the republicans who don't want to work with dems and it's true...  

post Reagan.. it's the democrats who have reached across the aisle the most... with Bill who moderated a ton to get re-elected... with Bush on 9/11 and the Iraq war... with Obama on health care using the outlines of a republican plan and inviting republican input....  and with trump on infrastructure...  

what evidence has their been the other way?  "
"On the leadership front... it will be Pelosi... but there have been rumors that she has been trying to cultivate a successor...  Joe Crowley was rumored to be one of them but he famously got ousted by Ocasio-Cortez in the primary...  

My take is that this term or next term will be her last.... She's going to be 80 by the end of this term and that's right around where retirement thoughts start creeping in for many....  The trouble is that there isn't anyone who's near ready to take her place...    "
"So there's a couple things to that... 

The incumbents in those states were facing off against some particularly weak opponents and Trump hardly paid attention to these seats... That is not going to be the case in 2020... The rural vote will turn out.... and if we're not over 70% turnout in the cities and suburbans in these states then we are definitely cooked...  

That's why 2020 is probably going to look a lot more like the Evers/Walker race....  Certain candidates might make the margin a little bigger but i don't think even Klobucher will win PA by larger than 2-3%(probably will run away with MN tho)...  

We have a very slim advantage but it is slim.... I seriously hope no one gets a false sense of security because Stabenow, Whitmer, Baldwin and Wolf ran away with their elections.... Things will be MUCH tighter in the presidential race and folks absolutely need to prepare for that...  "
"I like/love Sherrod Brown but he's not well-suited for a presidential race.... he's a great vp pick but we cannot lose his seat in the senate for that either...  

and yes the candidates need significant reach into the blue collar white workers.... this demographic will decide the race....  


"
"This might be obvious but I feel with the Beto/Abrams/Gillum attention the south got this midterm.... the key still remains the rust belt states... MN, WI, MI and PA...  

The entire math to 270 for BOTH republicans and democrats run through these states.... but Republicans only need ONE of these states to flip in a close race for us to LOSE...  

It's like trying to kick a 45 yd field goal into a slight breeze... the trends are equally not favorable for dems in these states as they lose a small but electorally significant amount of ppl every year...  

That means extra focus and strength is REQUIRED for these states... The same ole thing is NOT going to work and I guarantee huge losses if we don't...  "
"O'Rourke and klobuchar are not exactly centrist.... that ticket would be an easy winner in my eyes though....  "
"top down approach... could have happened with beto but sadly not gonna happen...  

bottom up can work... this was the dems in the 80s under reagan and had to rebuild the party with just the house under their control...  

all the folks who unseated incumbents need to get to work.... "
"overly negative is not gonna do it...  

we have to find a way to break into the bubble but hostility is an instant turn off....  

positive message... positive interactions with rural area ppl.... thats the only way to do it.."
"it sounds crazy but red states can elect blue candidates.. even in the senate...  

the problem was the old moderate dems got kicked out... new red state dems need to figure it out...  

beto/kander/abrams/gillum are probably on the right track but probably need to lean a hair right on some issues and i think we got a good formula..."
"i think organizing a massive amount of ppl within 24 hrs is completely reasonable.... a difference of 5 hrs at the end of day what does it matter? what does it impact?   hell 48 hrs i would even excuse.... or the first weekend...  

these are insignificant details.... to me at least... if they are to you that's fine also.... but if you really believe in the cause ... playing armchair organizer does it no good... seriously....  don't bitch to other ppl on the internet... go make your voice heard and get a real response from them and maybe you can actually impart positive change....  "
"i don't disagree entirely..... but there was a question of whether or not if we should be activating... and since it wasn't an automatic trigger... and the decision came what? 5-7pm est today?  

even they said an action after 5pm would be handled at 5pm the next day...  does this not follow those guidelines? "
"before you criticize... just try organizing something like this yourself....  it doesn't do any good raking ppl over the coals for... what amounts to... a 5hr delay?  

really?  you want to shit on ppl over that? what have you accomplished?"
"i would cut them some slack..... alot of folks who were probably involved were also probably/maybe involved in some late nights on election night....  

there were clear responses but they didn't account for sessions getting axed and so they probably also had to discuss it also....  

protests being at 5pm are probably for the better anyway....  "
"I have doubts that he will want to run but i will say that he will be a very popular vp pick if he doesn't..."
"texas gets ~100k in new ppl a year.... 

the problem is not that.... the problem is getting great candidates against a bad candidate... we had that this year but cruz wasn't quite bad enough....   

abbott won by big margins(~13%)... so there's still a large hill to climb... this is not a swing state by any means... "
"Given the results from last night.. how does that change the field for 2020 in your eyes?"
"if you noticed it never really fully recovered especially for those who took the L yesterday... 

of course it also means they were probably in more trouble than the polls let on since there were some decent sized misses but in terms of a galvanizing/divisive force... and it was an easy message to wedge voters... "
"Collins, Gardner and Jones are very vulnerable... with an open seat in AZ(McCain's old seat)... that's potentially +2...  

Thillis and Perdue are the next most vulnerable... it'll be tough but attainable with the right candidates... i'm looking at sally yates for GA... potentially +0 or +1..  

and i'll say this.. with the results out of IA and KS yesterday... Ernst and Roberts could be in play also....  but we're talking a huge confluence of events nationally to make that happen....  

so not impossible.. and kind of sort of looks ok... but winning the presidency and Sinema and tester holding on will go a long way towards 2020 also...  "
"tester and particularly bullock have been doing amazing things and they seriously do not get any credit on the national stage..."
"and that's why hanging onto the rust belt is a much easier ask than those other states... we had very solid candidates and relatively poor to mediocre GOP candidates in all those races and we still came up short..   

Converting suburbs requires a message that will probably alienate rust belt and rural areas.... it's a very hard balancing act.... and Hillary and red state dems struggled mightily with over the last decade....  and we all paid the price...  

it needs to change... we need to credibly win back some percentage of rurals or this will continue to be a problem for another decade....  "
"this is reality... you're rarely ever presented with ideal or easy scenarios in life...  

2006/08 was not that long ago and it took a lot of things happening nationally and a remarkable candidate to create a seismic shift... there was enormous work and some luck...  

it's not gonna be any different this time around....   "
"if you were following the polls... the senate probabilities took a big hit in Oct during the peak of the Kavanaugh hearings.... "
"we need an overwhelmingly positive change message....  beto had the right idea... harris and warren are not it..."
"2020 is going to be hard given the losses this round...  we will need a bad economy or huge revelations from Mueller because we will need to reach into NC(Thillis) and GA (Perdue) and likely IA (Ernst) or KS (Roberts) in a presidential election year....  realistically that's a tough ask if the status quo holds...  

Which means the status quo needs to be shifted... and that almost means the candidates don't matter...  "
"its not that... pollsters are not getting enough responses from non college educated voters..."
"that was the comey here.... it def cost nelson and mccaskill..."
"it's gonna be close but i'm optimistic... and i haven't been all that optimistic heading into tonight... "
"we needed the other guy to make it.... but it's a runoff ... strange things can happen... "
"polls are still open....  and if it's open somewhere they don't release any counts... "
"a lot easier.... but not if sinema loses and certainly not if rosen also does....  

+4 in optimistic scenarios.... likely +1 to +3 so these last few races are crucial...."
"the big swing states are now..... NV, FL(sort of cancel each other out)... NH... and the rust belt states....  PA is the battleground and whoever wins PA wins the presidency...  

that's the 2020 race in a nutshell...    "
"ga-06... seemed like ages ago when this started... is down to 100 vote difference and a recount...  "
"this is a 5... this was sort of a replay of 2016 with some inroads in suburbs and rebounds in the rust belt.. and that is now the status quo....  "
"it wasn't the money.... there was plenty of it and o'rourke gave to other races.... "
"no it's not polling non college educated voters enough....  it's a very clear pattern at this point.... "
"not all is lost....  red state dem senators have a complicated message....  but we're seeing what a solid candidate can look like in these states....   

tester(bullock also).... brown... connor lamb...   beto(lost but outperformed)....  manchin....   

i hate to say it but if we want to solidify 2020... we have to get a little more male... a lil younger....  and yes... probably a little whiter....  

the identity politics card is a strong one for trump.....  and if he doesn't have that he doesn't really have much....   "
"he will play a part in the 2020 scene somewhere... but he at the very least will be a very popular vp pick if not prez...   "
"i don't think he runs for prez altho i'm not too confident in that.... but i do know for sure that he is the #1 draft pick for vp for whoever does win....   "
"identity politics....  left leaning policies win... but identity trumps policy....  

you make a race less about identity you have a shot in red areas....  "
"tester is a good candidate..... so is bullock... they are part of the model for red state dems....   "
"well i still have high hopes for 2020....  but really all depends if we can make some pickups later tonight....  "
"i liked gwen graham.... but not sure if it was resulted differently....  

one thing is for sure.... the slate is clean in florida.... gop has been wildly more organized in FL for probably two decades now....  FL dems absolutely need to get back to the drawing board....  "
"yes much easier.....   potentially a +4 scenario but likely something like +2 or +3...   

all depending on the top of the ticket also...   "
"1% margins.... no it's not...   

florida does need some better candidates..."
"this is the normal under trump..... activated rural areas... activated urban areas.... 

this is what we have to deal with for better or worse.... "
"lots of races.... poor polling in spots.... leads to a fair amount of surprises all across the nation....  but on the whole it's running about what you'd expect if you follow 538..."
"they gain control of the house.... committees change leadership which is a major thing with investigations pending....   

more importantly a lot of crazy legislation likely gets blocked... meaning the ACA will likely live on.... if we lose the ACA repeal is probably back on the table.... "
"kris kobach out.... laura kelly in....   

kansas you pulled through today... "
"i don't think so.... the polls were off in indiana and florida by more than the moe..... so what we were getting in those states were routinely off....  

if anything the kavanaugh hearings had more of an effect and was absolutely much more polarizing.... "
"guys .... i know a lot of folks are down right now... but the house is still very much in the crosshairs and should've aligned with most expectations....  

the best good news at the moment is that altho indiana collapsed for donnelly... the rust belt democrats have and are holding strong.... THAT is absolutely CRUCIAL for 2020 and rebuilding the blue wall back up.....  

remember we win those rust belt states.... and the rest of the clinton states... you don't need florida.... you don't need ohio.... that gets you to 278.....  

keep the faith everyone... don't underrate the good that's happening now....  "
"senate dems were playing defense in a lot of tough states... so is skewed for republicans in that regard....  "
"a win would be a win..... take it anyway you can.... then take those lessons for 2020...  "
"yea although not quite as big as miami and broward.... why is it not reporting for gov?"
"rust belt ... besides indiana of course.... has been a bright spot....  they are pulling through... "
"when republicans get 2016 turnout numbers popular vote is possible but it gets real difficult in the EC....   

they need to win back SOME percentage of the rural vote to get back to romney numbers...  that probably doesn't happen unless the economy tanks... "
"polls not sampling enough noncollege educated voters.... same deal from 2016... and one of my biggest fears heading in....   

the weird thing is that turnout is huge almost everywhere.... but republicans are just as activated... "
"it really depends on the margins.... if we're -2 then probably fine... "
"indiana called for braun... guys... brace yourselves... mccaskill is likely in trouble also.... "
"the turnout numbers are 2016 levels which gives some hope.. but it will be extremely close.... "
"538: 
NATHANIEL RAKICH8:27 PM
You may have noticed that our real-time forecast has moved toward Republicans in the House. It’s being too aggressive, in my opinion. The model sees that a bunch of “likely Republican” districts (particularly in Florida) are now 100 percent likely to go red. But there hasn’t been the chance for Democrats to clinch many equivalent likely Democratic districts
"
"exit polls mean nothing.... but that's a bad poll question on top of it... "
"part of the rust belt... strong incumbent.... but bodes well for donnelly... "
"msnbc and wasserman coverage is by far the best of the night..."
"no... but it being close might not bode well overall... looking at MO senate race... "
"im particularly interested in indiana... that should tell us a lot about how the night will go....

if donnelly wins and gets called really early then it could be a real good night for dems... if its inline then we should also rest easy...

if its real tight then this could be 2016 all over again.... ive been paranoid about pollsters not sampling enough noncollege educated voters... and if thats the case we will see it in the results here and dems will be underperforming almost everywhere...."
"exit polls suck...  https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html  

agree that turnout talk is useless.... "
"7pm.... between 8-10pm is when results really start coming in and then from 10pm to midnite you have the west coast results...   "
"just going off 2016 results.... and yes not a 1-1 comparison...  
Miami-Dade - 291k + D difference  
Orange -   134k+ D   
Palm Beach - 102k+ D  

that totals up to a 527k vote difference with Sarasota and other counties generously adding up to 50k....   so potentially up to 475k difference with what's not being reported...  

now the difference in these midterms will probably not reach that high since we're looking at a lower turnout than 2016 (but maybe not by that much?).... but we're talking a considerable chunk of votes still out there....  

in short... don't freak out... what's missing is 3 out of the 4 biggest counties and they lean blue.... florida elections are almost always close and you can see why.... "
"that still doesn't take facebook, twitter or google off the hook...  

just because someone else's bigger problem doesn't excuse you from handling your own...  "
"this presidency and really the last couple of decades is proof enough that unless things are codified into a law.... conventions or norms are not enough to prevent someone from gaming the system....  

it's only a matter of time until a huge conflict occurs..."
"it's seriously not enough.... google.. twitter.. fb.. all of these folks need to step up their game a lot more.... any casual observation will show that... "
"sure... again i buy that... but all it takes is one... 

and if they decide to go partisan line... thats more things to hang around their necks to take their seats..."

the last marist and quinnipac poll of florida in 2016 also had npa's breaking for Hillary and that did not happen...  "
"you're right... altho i think a +2 dem outcome falls within the 80% outcome range on 538... it is still very unlikely... "
"i'm not saying he specifically will moderate... but out of a group of 5-6 senators... in an environment hostile to far right policies and appointments... one is likely to come.. "
"thats absolutely true but if trumps approval starts eroding and the margin  in the senate is 0 then you just need one senator to jump ship on a vote to also now give cover to all the endangered republicans that are up for reelection....  "
"an underrated aspect of the senate picture is that if dems even gain one ~~or two~~ seat... something that is within the realm of possibility... then that may be enough to significantly moderate any appointments...  

you have the usual suspects in Collins (ME).. Murkowski (AK)... as 'moderate' republicans... but people forget that Cory Gardner (CO).. Tom Thillis (NC)... Dave Perdue (GA)... are up in 2020 and will be under enormous pressure to moderate..    

and also don't forget that Romney (UT) is very likely to take Hatch's seat this election also and he'll likely want to take an anti-trump stance if he wants to run again for the executive in the future...  

So while the Senate is unlikely for Dem's.... any gain in seats should be seen as a huge win... "

"this is true... but if celebrity endorsements has any kind of effect in political races... this is it...  

this race wasn't getting that much attention until swift came in... and one of the biggest impacts an endorsement gives is just raising awareness of a race happening.... for midterms and for democrats that's a big deal... 

and swift's fanbase is primarily young females which in Tennessee is a very key demographic for breseden... "
"thats sort of true... but i would imagine the pull of all the celebrities behind clinton shouldve overcome trumps celebrity also..."
"a 50/50 senate is the likely best case scenario... and folks should not be disappointed by that outcome one bit....  "
"celebrity endorsements aren't exactly worth much... the 2016 election is proof where the power of scott baio was bigger than beyonce/jay-z, LeBron and 80% of hollywood...  

candidates aren't products.... and that's really the biggest difference.... "
"in the sense that ppl seem to think she might be a huge plus... but if you scrutinize her for even a tiny bit its probably gonna end up being a bad idea....

i mean what is actually appealing about her? that shes genuine?  if anything you could probably characterize everything shes done as a series of publicity stunts... i certainly dont characterize her as genuine.... 

soft on trump... hard on immigration... anti abortion for a time...  very hard on same sex marriage for a time.... and still about lukewarm on actual progressive positions except for the environment.... and thats not even getting into her whole assad fiasco.... 

shes probably a moderate democrat but the social conservative bernie version which is a bad an odd mix....

maybe some folks like her.... but if you do... i would urge them to dig a little deeper...."
"This actually matters here.... 

It's a good poll in the sense that folks who decide to vote based on how close they think a race is will probably get pushed to vote... this is a state with a high percentage of college graduates and people with advanced degrees AND had low turnout in 2016 (68% of registered voters) and really low turnout during the governor's race (35%)...  there are tons of ppl who follow the news and polling... at least the votes that matter for democrats in nj....  

one of the likely ways this race gets lost is lower than expected turnout.... I work with a lot of ppl from NJ and if it's expected to be close this will move a lot of people to the polls.... a lot of ppl don't vote because they feel their vote doesn't matter... and a lot of times in solid blue or solid red states that perception is really strong... "
"i mean we started out this conversation that twin being all flash made discard not great... look at the prior comments... this is not a straw man... you've been saying it the whole time... 

and i've been saying that it's simply not true... that it had to warp into a different deck postboard speaks to how strong it was... and postboard it's just as great.... how many times did you grab snap turn 1 thoughtseize/iok?  "
"of course it was close... I never contended otherwise.... 

did you side out iok against twin? were you ever not happy to draw it in your opening 7 in the matchup?  

the combo was a liability against gbx... it was a pretty favorable matchup for gbx until twin figured out to just side out the combo in the sideboard games because combo'ing through 6 forms of discard... 4-6 forms of removal... and lotv ... was a losing proposition....  when keranos came into the picture it became a lot closer...  

if you played the matchup at all you would know that... and you obviously don't....  "
"i can't honestly take the view that discard did nothing against twin and say that you actually played the matchup....  

the format had plenty of tools.... it was to interact....  and there were plenty of linear decks that had great matchups vs twin... ad nauseam... infect... burn... to name a few.... 
"
"its less about money since money is finite.... it sure informs the quality of candidates and the overall strategy...  

take for instance in 2014.. there were races where we werent even running candidates.... and the quality of candidates werent great either in some cases... republicans are facing that now.... and then it just becomes a self fulfilling prophecy... you underperform because you expect to underperform.... 

every race should be fought tooth and nail... even if it feels like youre going against the golden state warriors.. they still lose over 20% of the time... you give up and its zero.... 

a seat in the senate or the house are all weighted the same... with limited resources sure you can choose to prioritize but theres no excuse to not bring the same level of energy in all races.... the natural tendency is to not but you have to fight that tendency if you want to grab every seat you deserve..."
"giving up turns a 1 in 30 or 50 chance into a 1 in 100 or zero chance..  

just to give you an idea... a 1 in 30 or 50 chance means there will be a handful or more of surprises during this election cycle... theres almost a thousand of these if you include primaries....  and we already had one with ocasio-cortez...  

thats what happened during the mid terms in 06.... you catch some national momentum... you challenge everywhere you can and youll win in some places you never would have thought possible.... 

ppl think of an 80% or even 90% chance of winning as a zero percent chance.... and if you give up on all those kinds of races then thats a recipe to underperform... thats what the strategy was under DWS and thats why it failed miserably.... and thats why the senate races in NJ(menendez) and MN(Smith) should be keeping a lot of ppl up at night..."

i mean look this is just semantics on what qualifies as politics... the mods of this sub have been very clear on what is and isnt allowed... and generally have been fairly lenient in that regard.... 

i can at least see the reasoning behind removing it... its not some outlandish thing to do when it hasnt even been confirmed to be politically motivated...."
"why is any soros story a political story? he is quoted a lot in the media related to his views on economics/finance....  

he's a public figure... but his primary view from the public's perspective is NOT politics.... from r/politics view it is of course... but things happening to him or because of him are generally not political news... "
"there are lots of people who are political donors.... George soros is a very public figure in the finance world... it's the equivalent of someone finding a bomb for bill gates or warren buffet....  

it hasn't been confirmed if it was politically motivated or not.. certainly speculation could easily point to it being that... but the rules of the sub ... rule #1... expressly state that it has to tie directly related to us politics...   

if I was a mod I would have removed it to...  I don't really see how it's that big of a deal... it belongs in r/news... "
"i can tell you didn't play the matchup at all from either side.... keeping cards in your hand was/is a struggle against gbx... there's no answer for discard... you have the combo in your hand and flash in someone... and your combo is gone anyway until you draw it again....  remand? lolok...  

instead of theorycrafting a matchup you have no experience in... just load it up on cockatrice with a friend or against yourself... and just see... i'll be happy to play it with you on either side if you want also.... "
"compared to jund? compared to affinity?  compared to anything else on the banlist?  

affinity during the bloom meta had 3 less gp top 8 appearances... jund about 6 less...  bloom had more top 8 conversions...  

all those decks had more overall success up to that point... proof is out there if you are willing to look..."
"you dont have to take my word for it... just go back to any old article... no one considered it a favorable matchup for twin... no one ever... it is simply false.."
"did jund not play thoughtseize or iok?  they had almost 16 cards to disrupt it...  "
"it was only clearly #1 during summer bloom meta.... gbx was actually a better deck even taking out deathrite shaman for a larger part of modern's history....  

twin was tier 1.. no question... but this revisionist history that it was some sort of oppressive deck is just flat out wrong.... it was never that even at the height of its powers....  "
"what you're describing are ideal situations vs jund... and if you're only looking at that then of course it looks great... but in reality... 

a resolved goyf and lotv were enormous problems... snap was the only way to get those off the board at card parity.... but you only had 4 of those and need a bolt in hand and 4 mana.... 

remand and the twiddle creatures were only tempo gains but you very often get to a point in the game where jund has 5 lands or 2 or more creatures and it's worth very little....  you had 8 cards twin had no good answers for... 2 spellsnare and that's about it... while jund only had to worry about the combo of which they quite often had 14-16 cards(discard/removal)... that's why game 1 gbx was favored...  

jund actually had a very favorable matchup until twin fought back with siding in keranos.... that was the only card advantage engine that tilted the matchup past turn 5...  but that really only made the side games about 50/50.... 

 "
"a 1/4 or 2/1 for 3 mana is gonna outrace a 4/5 for 2 mana? really?"
"twin was only powerful when blood moon was powerful as it was the best blood moon deck in a meta with summer bloom....  

in all other metas it was t1 but never really the best deck... look it up.."
"twin almost always sided out of the combo in games 2 and 3... the combo was a liability in the matchup... and that should tell you the assumptions you are making are wrong... 

add to the fact that goyf was really hard to deal with in non jeskai colors was why gbx was favored if ever so slightly....  

and thats not to mention lotv..."

it may or may not be true... I don't really follow election betting all too closely.... I do know that the population of ppl who bet on things is wildly different than the population at large... so I would be careful to assume that the group... esp since it is dollar-weighted... has the same biases as whatever you think the average person is....  "
">America is much more conservative than say... Europe, where the vast majority of legal betting on American politics occurs. This would in and of itself lead to a liberal bias in the betting markets.   

I was kind of sort of following along... until there... 

if America leans more right than Europe then.. by your logic... all it means is that it's more right than Europe.... 

if a bias exists... then.. again by your logic... it should be more right leaning... but you're saying it's not?  

I really want to understand you... but it's not really computing for me... "

"look i'm giving you a full opportunity to back your claims.... what you provided is clearly not what you think it is...  

there's nothing in that article that is describing what you are asserting... if i'm wrong then show me... you are the one who linked it....  

i've been wrong before and i have no trouble admitting when i am... do you?"
"that source doesn't speak to the 2016 campaign... it's from Aug 2018...  and it also references only Iran and Russia.. not China...  

and we're talking about youtube channels and blogs that got a total of ~1.3k views... this isn't the same as the Russian campaign on twitter, fb, google and reddit.... of which it easily dwarfs whatever numbers you're citing...  

is there something else you're basing your conclusions on?"

source for us common folk perhaps?"

seriously... you cant bring yourself to look at what he actually said?  are you afraid of something?  

you dont even need to respond and say you were wrong... just read it... you might learn something..."
"no he didnt... look at his quote...  

that is not sexual assault... what he describes is exactly what every teenage boy goes through... you and i both know it... so knock it off...  

and dont tell me im partisan... when you cant bother to look at the original quote and cant possibly conceive that you have a very warped view of what he said...  

its a false interpretation to the point of lying... "
"sorry... no.. 

sayingg he admitted to sexual assault is being disingenuous... and its transparent and very much not appreciated....  "
"he is applying to the highest court in the land.... thats probably like applying at walmart.. but not the same..  "

i think the ' mark' that he meant was actually robbing a bank... 

plotting to rob a bank is a crime right?"
"not just voting... real interactions with real ppl will make more of a difference...  

voting is def important too"
"its bad... but theres good that come out of it... im sure a lot of folks.. alot of young folks now realize how important elections are..."
"that's probably true... but let's not conflate that this is some sort of both sides can see this differently situation....  

a reasonable person can read tthe use of the word 'mark'... especially in the context of the entire article he wrote... and look at the preceding words right before and after and conclude that he didnt' just go in again..... 

and then certainly not equate it to pinning someone on the floor and covering the girl's mouth so she couldn't scream....   "
"so this is battery? yes battery has a wide definition but no jury would consider this battery... esp when the girl initiated the kiss and they were already groping each other....  

that he then moved to the breast and she rebuffed isn't a crime....  

when you pin someone down on the floor and cover their mouth... you would have way more juries who would consider that a crime...  "
"who was gonna convict based on 30 yr old evidence?  who actually believed that?

"
"you can be pissed but when you're answering questions under oath AND applying for the highest court in the land... you're expected to not only keep your cool but answer questions as honestly as you can...

"'oh russia couldn't have done the dnc hack... they're too good to be caught doing it!'

but it's telling that you would pick those things out.. but not look at the inconsistencies from kavanaugh.... "
"that's based off of what?  another person's account of what booker said?  what the girl said?  

booker never said that... and they are not citing what the girl said...  

https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&d=stanford19920219-01.2.16

that's the primary source...  

this is what booker actually said...  

>After having my hand pushed away once, I reached my ""mark."" Our groping ended soon and while no ""relationship"" ensued, a friendship did.  
"
"and in case it isn't clear... this is false... no where does he state that he repeatedly tried to grab her breast... he said:  

>After having my hand pushed away once, I reached my ""mark."" Our groping ended soon and while no ""relationship"" ensued, a friendship did.  "
"groping during a consensual romantic engagement is not sexual assault....  

groping during an unwanted or coerced engagement is...  "
"try naming an actual crime... groping can be part of a crime but does this type of groping constitute that?

"
"what is your point?  you're saying they are the same thing...  

i'm saying they are not... those are not two situations of groping... one is an attempted rape... the other is a common miscommunication among two people already engaged romantically without violence or coercion...   

I want to understand you... but maybe i'm taking crazy pills but that's seriously not the same thing... and you continually mischaracterize what booker said on top of that...  

so try again.... i'm listening... "
"so you're saying that kavanaugh was merely groping when ford accuses him of putting his hand over her mouth from screaming and pinning her to the bed?  

and comparing that to....  

booker already engaging in a romantic kiss with a girl and touching her breast and the girl told her to stop and he complied...   

and you categorize both as 'groping'?  

really?"
"that's not sexual assault...  

edit:  that also does not say he groped her after she pushed him away... no where did it say that because booker NEVER said that...  

he explicitly said that he touched her breast.. she rebuffed... and that was his 'mark' to stop... "
"they can try to do whatever they want... that should not dictate what ppl do... if they want to divorce themselves from reality then that's their prerogative...  

they tried to paint Obama as an un-American muslim terrorist...  should Obama not have run because of that?  

if booker crossed a line... then he shouldn't be running... if he has actual skeletons in his closet... then he shouldn't be running...  

this is not an actual skeleton... "
"no the biggest difference is that they are completely different....  

that's not sexual assault in booker's situation... "
"I read it... where did it say he was guilty of something similar to what kavanaugh is guilty of?  "
"there is no controversy.... what booker is describing is very common among teenage boys... what ford alleged is like in a completely different ballpark...  

when you're romantically kissing someone... groping is involved... there's already an understanding of attraction... it's up to the two ppl involved what that materializes in... reaching for a breast and getting rebuffed is the equivalent of a disagreement.... there's no violence... there's no ripping of clothes... there's no let me touch it or else... there's no coercion involved in any part of what booker is describing.. and hence that's not assault... 

ford was alleging something completely different... in another ballpark.... and yes coercion is a big part of that.... "
"and when did that happen? btw... how the person you were replying was wrong or intentionally misleading... he didn't grab and try to grab again... it was once .. he got rebuffed...  and then stopped... 

here's booker's article...  

https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&d=stanford19920219-01.2.16"
"so you're saying that taking a hard stance against gangrape is the same as getting rebuffed in a teenager's attempt to get to second base?  

I think you're the only one conflating the two... "
"these allegations were out there... it was until the extent of which were out there and became more credible did it gain traction...  

ford went to Feinstein's office... Feinstein's office told her to get a lawyer... then she went to WAPO.. and then it became public.... and then that's where things started to snowball...  

no one was sitting on anything... and if there's a perception of that then they are missing those details which republicans conveniently leave out... 

republicans are good at it because it's black and white.. it supports what they do or it doesn't... and their rhetoric will match it... it's easy to understand until you do a deeper dive but most folks aren't willing to do that... "
"because he votes with them when they actually need it.... 

capito is the WV republican senator... her vote is already counted... you much prefer that I assume... "
"who in the middle are blaming democrats?  

this is a process COMPLETELY controlled by republicans.... "
"need a total of 2 republicans to vote no... if we count Murkowski as one.. then either flake or Collins... 

you also have manchin but it's unlikely he votes yes as the deciding vote... "
"he's not.... a republican is capito who's vote is already counted at this point...  

manchin's not gonna be the deciding vote... he has to walk the tightrope... "
"theres nothing partisan about what she said.... she said the president has an ego and inconsistent... its a criticism and a rather tame one at that but that wasnt a reference or led to any political or legal action... 

kavanaugh was spouting off about conspiracies against him which are inherently political actions... thats partisan... "
"please quote to what she said.... and quote what kavanaugh said... they are completely different..."
"No... they need to respect the process ... blanket blocking of anything is not conducive to a functioning gov't...  which republicans have frankly demonstrated time and again..... 

They should confirm based on the merits of the nominee.... however given the potential list of nominees there's a lot of good justification to vote any of them down...  

In any case given Trump's m.o... he will probably nominate whoever the most divisive guy/gal is going to be anyway so functionally dems will be blocking whoever he nominates.... "
"so just because its personal that standards that are ser forth for any judge let alone SCOTUS dont apply?

how would a judge treat a witness that answered questions like he had?  "
"this is not a court of law... this is still a job interview.... a job interview where impartiality.. respect for due process... a respect for the oath you take before taking the stand... and the temperment to handle public scrutiny are key qualifications....  

in all those.. he failed miserably....  if im applying to walmart and they accuse me of raping ppl... you could maybe excuse the type of behavior kavanaugh displayed....  

but hes not....  the bar is set much much higher for SCOTUS... or at least it was... "
"so youre saying its more important than fully vetting a candidate?  

speed is important sure... but there was nothing stopping the president from withdrawing and nominating anyone else if thats really the priority...  

if there is some self imposed deadline... then its up to the president to make sure a nominee can survive scrutiny to meet that deadline... all it really took was nominating someone who didnt have these questions... gorsuch didnt... roberts didnt... alito didnt...  thomas did... and he went through the process....    

dems cant stop this anyway... dems cant approve an investigstion.... they dont have the votes to stop the nom...  why is that they sre being blamed for a process that republicans have COMPLETE control over?"
"there's no proof that the dems leaked it... based on the info out there it was actually probably wapo.... she went to Feinstein's office... Feinstein told her to get a lawyer and that was it...  afterwards she went to wapo for an off-the-record interview...  

THEN the media circus began.... and the dems have been calling for an investigation as more and more info has come to the light... you know... as things got more credible...  

you are blaming them without all the information.... go look it up.. "
"he wasnt the first choice from the gop establishment... probably because thry knew of the potential of things that are out there... mcconnell reportedly tried to talk trump out of nominating him..  

he was picked because of trump and/or kennedy basically... "
"this is a job interview... more important than the actual allegations is his response to those allegations...  

he is nominated for the supreme court... he is a judge... his respect for due process does not mean the bar for that seat... "
"all of this didnt really gain much traction until very late... that might be because of the timing of the confirmation process but it does take some time for things to materialize... 

in any case how do you expect republicans would have received any request for an fbi investigation at any point?"
"so whenever theres a supreme court nomination theres a witchhunt from the opposing party?

or this happens every 30 yrs?"
"even if we assume if feinstein did leak it... if the accusations werent credible then its no big deal right?"
"and what could she have expected from closed senate hearings when republicans are expected to plow through a vote even with todays testimony and without an investigation..... 

yea... reasonable... "
"what was she supposed to do? what if it wasnt credible? she told her to get a lawyer... which is the best advice anyone could give... any more than that and you open up lines of questioning that she was working with her to manufacture a story...  

republicans have done it anyway... but its less straws for them to grab..."
"this is what she said in referring to trump:

>He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.""

that is a far far far cry from what kavanaugh said....  "
"what did they do with gorsuch?  where is the assumption that they'll try to block someone for 2 more years even coming from? "
"how many supreme court justices have even been accused of rape or other major violent crimes?"

that doesn't mean texas isn't turning more blue... it's just that you shouldn't draw too big a conclusion from one race... this state still elected trump by a hefty margin and the only reason it drew attention was that it wasn't a bigger blowout... 9 pt margin even with generic candidates can take decades before it's considered a battleground....

and all of a sudden... the focus would have been less on the election than what Obama was doing to effect it... and maybe he should've done it anyway but I hardly fault him for it... it's not an easy call to make if you're trying to make a judicious decision for the country... 

are you protecting the election by injecting yourself in it? or are you making the problem not about the election? we won't know but McConnell made sure that it was gonna be the least palatable option for him because that was the worst option for his party... "
"i was saying that the deck makes remand bad... not the other way.."
"it honestly wouldn't look all that different... the flex slots and the splash variants were basically meta calls.... grixis would still probably want discard/fatal push and jeskai still wants path, colonnade and the sideboard cards... so you'd see a lot of different cards in there but those would be in slots where ppl try to get creative anyway.... 

the deck would still struggle against any control deck(UW)... decks that beatup on remand(hollow one/burn).... and tron would still be roughly an even matchup... kci and humans would probably be favored.... 

so I think it would be a top tier deck but it wasn't even that oppressive before.... the only time it was the top deck was right before it got banned... and it was only that good because of it's amulet bloom matchup... and it was up there with the other good blood moon deck(affinity).... 

we still don't know a meta where twin was without bloom.... and that's really what made the decision so stupid...

">I'll make an edit to the relevant previous post to clarify. Thanks for continuing despite my stubbornness.  

Thank you... and I will concede that this was mainly an argument over semantics...  

I think it's important to not dismiss what is already out there as it was fairly widely known that it was Russia's GRU who was responsible for the breach... which was my main point of contention... we had a pretty good idea about this already based on what's in the public domain... even though the evidence alone was not enough to say within a reasonable doubt... it was enough to highly suspect and if you trusted the opinions of numerous experts then it probably was enough...  

I thought there were attempts to dismiss that on your part.. I was wrong about that and this was merely just an argument over semantics... but something I thought was important to clear up...

"no .. the technical evidence is in the public domain.. what's not is the human intelligence... intercepted signal intelligence... that's classified....

in a murder.. you cannot convict anyone based on a murder weapon alone(fingerprints and other identifying info aside)... you need a suspect... and you need something that links them to the murder weapon... like video footage... alibi's... eye witness testimony....

it's no different here... the way you are phrasing things... you are saying a murder weapon is not admissable in a court when it very obviously is... just because a knife or a gun cannot in isolation convict someone doesn't mean it's useless.... it just means you need other things...  

and what's out in the public domain is the equivalent of the murder weapon and a trail of identifying information along the way...."

At the same time... it's a bit flippant to dismiss it given that crowdstrike and the security industry at-large came to the same conclusions as the special counsel... and while the special counsel's went a bit deeper indicting specific people... all of them implicated the gru Russia's intelligence outfit..."
"It's not really a good communication tool for speeches because it's very hard for a non-TV audience to see it clearly and interpret it.. and even on TV it's not great...

You generally want visual aides when your audience is smaller than what politicians face on a daily basis...

"which investigation are you referring to?

i'm not referring to anything specific btw... but the collection and i have a feeling whatever house republican investigation your referring to aligns with that... given that house republicans still refuse to perform basic duties like bringing in witnesses for testimony related to the russia investigation....

your quote:

again... your quote:

source quote:

>*Rosenstein is fighting a guerilla war against Republicans on Capitol Hill and Donald Trump,*

where does it say it was partisan?"

>After all, the signature lesson of Mueller’s inquiry at every turn has been that his investigators knows far, far, far more than anyone in the public expected.

One piece of that might be the [Dutch video evidence](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-26/release-the-dutch-evidence-of-the-dnc-hack).... but it seems like there may have been a counter-hack of some sort or maybe Google handed over some info...  "

"Also just to add... since my other comment got buried... [Pew also did a very similar poll](http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/).. which also goes back further than 2016... and found the opposite effect found in the Ipsos/Reuters poll...

>The 8-percentage-point Democratic advantage in leaned partisan identification is wider than at any point since 2009, **and a statistically significant shift since 2016, when Democrats had a 4-point edge (48\% to 44\%).** The analysis in this report draws on more than 10,000 interviews with registered voters in 2017 and tens of thousands of interviews conducted in previous years (see Methodology for additional detail).  

That's not to say that the Ipsos/Reuters poll is wrong and Pew is right or vice versa... It's that you shouldn't make snap judgements or form narratives off the back of one single poll..."
"This idea is based on a single poll (ipsos/reuters) which was conducted a few months ago... which coincidentally [there was another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/8g1ren/a_new_reutersipsos_poll_suggests_that_democrats/) in this subreddit about it at the time...  

So just taking another comment from that thread... there was another other poll conducted by Pew that showed the opposite effect... [that party identification was widening for young voters between Democrats and Republicans](http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/)...  

So I would say that it is a bad assumption that ""Democrats are losing millennials""... and anyone who follows polling should know that you shouldn't get too deep into the cross tabs... or put too much weight into one poll... and certainly not make a definite statement out of it... "

thats basically curry, klay and draymond but also applies to butler..lillard.. and you name it... "
"and this is why guys who see prospects for a couple of hours are bad at drafting..."
"og anunoby alone would be worth it... he's 20 yo... which is younger than Mikal and miles bridges... he's proven to be at least an nba level player which is what you probably won't get with knox....  

if og was back in this draft he'd probably go higher than 9 definitely...  

I would ask for delon wright also.... and if we managed to pull that off we'd have a tremendous young team... "
"i'm pretty sure front offices do dumb things all the time... like basing very important decisions based entirely... and with knox.. it is entirely... on a few hrs in an empty gym....  and ignoring a whole college season's worth of play...  

environment matters.... but you can only blame the environment to an extent... you can put a really talented player on any team and they'll find ways to contribute positively... really bad players have a tougher time....  

and knox has more in common with second rd draft picks than traditional lotto SF types... he would be the worst SF drafted in the lotto this century with the numbers he put up....  "
"but what i'm saying is that wiggins is the upside... there's a rather large chance that he's well short of that... which would make him an unplayable player...  

wiggins is barely playable now and the only reason he sees time is because of hope and the contract that he has....  

if you want a more closer comparison.... look at sam dekker... that's probably what knox is gonna become... and if you don't believe me check out their numbers... "
"but if you're that massively talented why are those even excuses?  talented players find ways to produce no matter the environment....  

you don't need to fit around other players to grab rebounds... steal or block shots... and he's very poor at all those things....  

SGA struggled also but he turned it on the last couple of months on both sides of the ball.... knox continued to meander the whole year...  "
"it's much easier to find and play the most talented guys and figure out how to make it work....  

for example... what's an easier question to answer 'how does carter guard opposing stretch 4's?' or... 

'can this guy make buckets?' or 'can this guy protect the rim?' ... 

guys like kevin love or pau gasol or derrick favors... you're going to play them 25+mpg... it's much easier to fill in the bench that can answer the defensive questions than find a guy who can answer every single one of them... that's what LeBron.. davis and Giannis are... 

we don't have the luxury of being able to pick that kind of guy... so you have to pick your poison... "
"i'm saying that passing up someone who is as skilled as carter... and yes... he was as good as love was in college...  is a mistake...  

there are plenty of top defensive teams that play two bigs... or wind up hiding a poor defender at the 4... love is a perfect example of that.... and you just don't pass up guys that are that talented... 

you find out a ways to make it work... esp if they have other skills that are massively helpful on the court and carter is an example of that type of guy.. .this isn't greg monroe or okafor or al Jefferson... he's significantly better than all those guys... "
"so are you saying that if kevin love was in this draft... that you're just gonna say 'no thanks' to him because he's not good against golden state or Houston?   

that to me is crazy.... and carter has better defensive ability than love.... so it makes it even crazier....  

there are other basketball skills that are just as... if not more.. important than being able to stick your hand up against ryan anderson or kelly olynk in the corner... "
"who are you putting at the 4 that's gonna stop any of those guys anyway?  

kevin knox? that guy?"
"how many teams are starting 4s that you need to be scared about on the perimeter?"
"nope... how anyone looks at him and sees tremendous upside or athleticism is beyond me....  

the guy wasn't even the most impressive freshman on the team.... SGA was the guy carrying the team after the new year.... and knox was basically an afterthought....

how many decks that splash blue currently could benefit from more consistency?  i imagine a whole lot.... how many decks would splash blue just for preordain? unknown but i bet it's >0&#37;...  

and altogether that probably adds up to something significant... you have to remember that a whole lot of decks play serum but they skip on sleight/opt because it's not that great.... preordain will not replace serum... but it will replace sleight/opt for the decks that play it... or it replaces some other card....  

that's a pretty significant change and has enormous implications....  "

based on that I don't know how anyone could say chain migration is actually what conservatives and Donald trump think it is... or that it is interfering with employment immigration...

"the whole 'decks can't play 3 drops argument' is a very weak one... liliana has been a staple in gbx decks for as long as the format has been alive....  the reason it could play it was because it interacted....  

modern has always had linear strategies.... and it's always been a challenge to devote sideboard slots for all of them... that is by design and that design has made modern enjoyable for a lot of people because they can play a lot of different decks... play against a lot of different decks.... and make a lot more cards playable...  
"
"The metagame wasn't all about twin at any point in modern's history.... right before it got banned was probably it's most popular point because it gave bloom titan the best game and was the best blood moon deck... even during that time affinity had as many top 8 finishes as twin did...  which surprise also played blood moon....  

At all other points it was overshadowed by other decks... and most ppl don't realize but modern hasn't exactly been a stable format... It's actually been more unstable as it has been stable.... We've averaged at LEAST one major banning or one major unbanning every year.... 

A metagame without Bloom would have seen twin go back to what it was WIDELY considered at the time... about as powerful as jund and affinity... and the data backs that up.... jund and affinity saw way more success since inception than twin ever did....  


"
"if they made twin cost 1RRR that would have solved all the gripes... it started popping up in goryo's vengeance shells and various three color versions of the deck were always popular and i think that was the main reason it was banned.... it was a fairly low cost to jam it in various shells...   

as it stands... with jace in the format... i highly doubt we will see twin back... "
"it's probably not a great matchup for humans... i play ur kiki and my best matchup is humans.... there's some percentage diff with freebooter taking twin while not being able to take a kiki... the deck needs A)aether vial + reflector mage or B)two of freebooter/meddling mage in order to stop the combo... A is only a temporary answer... and B is only an answer until you draw another piece of removal...  

of course the combo isn't going to be live every game... and a great fast draw with cavern and vial can eat a lot of twin's opening hands for breakfast...  but the sideboard games come with a lot more answers also... i rarely lose with ur kiki against humans and i don't think twin would be better.... "
"yes it is... there weren't many ppl playing the deck which was why it wasn't banned sooner and it was very much format warping once more and more ppl started picking it up....  

imo.... the not talked enough reason for the twin ban was because of bloom.... it was one of the only decks that could stand a chance against it because of blood moon in the board which was one of the reasons why twin was strong during that time.... 

if twin wasn't banned with bloom we would have seen it be as popular and strong as jund was/is.... "
"i'm with you on doncic but being as talently bereft as we are we should take whoever the best player available is....  

and i do think carter is a fair bit of a better prospect than mikal is.... i mean if we can get an elton brand/al horford type of player ... that's more useful to us than say an otto porter type...  

and don't get me wrong.. i love mikal also... but i think he's definitely inferior to carter in a lot of ways...  "
"i [wrote extensively](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/84a5bb/prospect_watch_by_the_numbers_wendell_carter/) on carter a little while back so i agree with the assessment... he is probably the best big in the draft but because he's not flashy with great size or athleticism he is in the shadow of other bigs....  

to put in the perspective... the numbers he's putting up is better than both kevin love or al horford... and they were easily top 5 picks in good drafts... he's pretty similar to elton brand and he was a #1 overall pick... he's for real....  "
"Thoughtseize/counters, etched champion ....  also ancient grudge for platinum emperion because they will bring that in.... and maybe a blast or two if you see staticaster.... "
"I tried it also and snag is probably better... the one mana difference matters during the early turns and its much more important to out tempo them... particularly turns 1-3 and youre often not facing multiples in those turns...  

If there was an unsummon effect that cantrips for two mana or less that would make things pretty awesome for this deck...."
"Its the difference of about two cards... but those two cards ....  

A)can save you 2-6 more life....  thats buying effectively an extra card or two and quite often the difference between winning and losing... i cant say that ive  won too many games with pestermite beats that i wouldnt have also won with exarch...  but there have been plenty of times where ive had to block with pestermite and effectively lose a creature for free where exarch would have lived.... and losing card advantage in this deck will lose you the game way more often....  

And one extra kiki isnt being so much more of a combo deck... its just more efficient use of a card slot... that one kiki makes you combo between 5-20% more often between turns 5-10....  there arent that many cards that can have that much an impact...  and what am i replacing it with? Opt? A remand? The third blood moon? All those cards are either low impact and/or be equally as bad in multiples..."
"and he did this in the middle of the golden era for big men.... "
"the term 'mobile' is such a subjective term.... i don't like using it but i would not classify lma, gasol, ibaka, jonas or favors as anything close to that.... if you think they are i'm positive carter is better than that...  

but playing the pnr isn't all about athleticism and quickness... it's positioning and how you handle the switch or rotate back... it's how quick you contest.... there's a lot of awareness required with that and it takes most big men a long time to develop that....

that's not just unique to carter.... it applies to everyone... it's not enough to just be quick and long....  "
"Well there isnt much in the way of evidence since duke played a lot of zone... but a big man playing the pnr is the biggest adjustment any college player has to make since they see so little of it in college....  

Deandre jordan and drummond and just about everyone not named duncan or davis took a long time to develop that ability... the guards and the schemes are just on another level than what they typically see...  

So its a bit of guesswork but i happen to think he will be fine... hes a smart guy with good basketball instincts... and thats probably more important than athleticism in a lot of cases..."
"Well if you think that those guys are mobile... carter is just as mobile as those guys....  

Hes not slow footed by any means... is he the athlete that jackson and bamba are? Probably not... but being skilled and smart matters too.... probably moreso than athleticism...  "
"how many bigs can do that? how mobile are 4's in today's nba?  

spurs have gasol and lma.... they have a top 5 defense... the raptors have ibaka and jonas... they are a top 10 defense... the jazz have favors and gobert... they are the #2 defense.... i mean even the rest of the top 10 defenses don't have amazing athletes at the 4 spot....  

"
"that's a good point... but the general idea is that there is at least some consistency and a moral compass....  

we should allow for difference in opinion and interpretations.... and not be critical of folks who are 'late to the party'.... that's sort of an elitist attitude and is counterproductive if you ever want ppl to see it from your viewpoint....  "
"everyone's line is different.... Fox hasn't exactly been a purveyor of truth... but being wildly partisan isn't a line most ppl draw.... this goes for liberals also.... no matter how naked and blatant it is...  

the only way to make traction with the folks who are 'indoctrinated' is to welcome differences in opinion but to draw the line at what should be universally objectionable things that are happening...  "
"Bennett is a good college coach but probably bad for the pro's... the pack-line defense is not very viable in the nba and his defenses are tough because of that... He would have to change his approach and system drastically....  

Jay Wright is another good name... his 4 out offense is very much what a lot of teams run... and he's very much about developing a great culture which would be a good long term thing...  

Calipari we all know about... and i'm not advocating for him.... But i feel like with age might have moderated his hunger for control... He's helped develop a ton of future prospects and i think if given the opportunity he could be successful again with the right environment.. not that he wants to leave that cushy UK job...  

That environment is probably not with the knicks though but I think he can find some success if given another opportunity somewhere...   "

"It might not be what you're used to seeing but I'm pretty sure there's probably more thought put into it than some of the popular mocks... they are just mimic'ing old scouting reports and old mocks....  

That's why everyone's mocks generally look the same... They don't question Ayton's or Bagley's defensive abilities... They have no idea who Gafford or Troy  Brown is... and they have Doncic not at #1....  

To me I find those things to be very telling... but everyone has their opinions.... My work is only meant to add to the discussion... and I have no idea why it would generate this much hate.... "
"Ponds is really underrated.... He's every bit as good as any pg not named Trae and probably better.. the numbers show it....  

Sexton has been ok but my opinion of him wavers because of his defensive numbers... he's a lot like lou williams.. but I think that's a best case for him.... he could end up like malik monk....  

Knox is basically just a shooter.... he doesn't really have other skills.... "
"I know people might find that weird... but I'm not the only [who questions Ayton's viability](https://www.theringer.com/2017/12/7/16743900/deandre-ayton-arizona-blocks-nba-draft).... 

>Here’s the problem. A guy with Ayton’s incredible physical tools should block a lot of shots, and he just doesn’t. He’s much bigger and longer than the vast majority of the players he faces in college. If he just stands in front of the rim and waves his arms around, he should block shots by osmosis alone. It’s concerning, because centers who don’t block shots in college have not fared well in the NBA. Ayton is blocking shots at a historically low rate for a future lottery pick. There have been 17 NCAA centers drafted in the top 10 since 2010, and Ayton’s freshman year block rate is tied with Cody Zeller’s for second-lowest among the players in that group.  

Like I said... I don't claim to be clairvoyant.... but you would have been called crazy if you thought Okafor would have busted too....  "
"I missed it... but it didn't look like he struggled... 14/10/2/2/2 with 6/9 from 2...

"Thanks... I feel like 'high floor' is selling Carter a bit short tho I agree that he's a safe pick... High floor usually implies low ceiling but I think his upside is fairly high just because of how skilled he is on both sides of the court..... guys like Love or Horford are perennial All-Stars and all they do is play good basketball....  

How he does on defense is going to determine what his upside is... if he can actually play credible minutes at C like Horford then he could potentially be better than him....  "

"I'm not sure if that's ever happened... trading a lotto pick for a future lotto pick on draft day....

"Generally good advice... but i tend to not like the defer to 'market rate' during negotiations unless it's wildly below what is considered market rate....  the market rate is an average and the company generally does not care what the market rate is... only what you mean to them...   

I like to frame negotiations with whatever number they feel is the floor for the position... and then make the case of why you don't just fill the requirements but that you can exceed them.... If that has value and they agree.. they will pay a little more for that... 

You generally should know how much the position is worth.. but that's usually just a ballpark.... each company has different goals and views of how they value and use certain positions.... each negotiation is different and you should have a good feel for who is in more of a position of strength and that will dictate how much money you will end up with....

"he literally played a little over half of the available minutes... he was also starting and he wasn't playing against bench guys... that's where things like per 40 and per 36 might overestimate players....

being young is simply not good enough... you need to produce... and the bar is very high.. porter's simply hasn't met that...  "

That might indicate that it's an issue where nationally declining crime rates and gun ownership might help them out long term....

c)the situations where you shoot 3s in college will be different in the nba.... in college.. you will probably have more pull up type of 3s while in the nba it's probably more catch and shoot...  

Just look at Kawhi... he was a 25% 3p shooter in college... 70+% at the line...  On the flipside Justise Winslow shot 40% from 3 but 60% from the line....

That is a very large gap... and you can tell it mirrors his abilities on the floor... he blows a lot of layups which other guards have no problems finishing...

you're probably not going to find out the what since that is classified.... but yes... according to FBI Director Christopher Wray... and Adam Schiff... there are facts missing that would make this memo ~~more~~ accurate... period...

the question is can you make the story compelling enough to differentiate itself?  in my minds... alot of what's come out in the last 10-15 years are really good modern takes on those old stories... 

uncharted series is a fine example... we haven't gotten a great adventure movie in ages and it's a great spin on the genre.... it was one of the only games that i liked purely to continue the story....  knights of the old republic captured the spirit of the OT than any of the movies since and still vastly different story wise....

i don't agree with this whole false equivalence/blurring the lines argument.... republicans are saying that the analysis is false because it will pay for itself.... another side is saying there's no free lunch.... it's fairly easy to see who has a more compelling argument in this case...  

and it's because of that i don't think the vox article was too far off... they chose a more literal summary from the tax policy center which was actually more faithful....  if you had a problem with vox... you have a problem with the tax policy center analysis.... "

you're not the only one who's been doing it... but it's weird... and there are a handful of you guys devoted to creating a narrative.... and i'm asking questions.... "
"wow trying to get personal... what did i do to you?  

most ppl disagree with you.... despite your enormous efforts to convince ppl otherwise.... it's still gonna make a shitload of money...  

i was the same way during TFA... and while i didn't like TLJ... some of the shit ppl are throwing it's way is out of bounds... so no there's no cognitive dissonance.... i think after you mature a little bit you'll come to the same conclusion eventually.... "

i've already added my piece when i went to go see it opening night....  i've been looking at what's happening over the internet and i came into this thread to search out what's actually happening...

cinemascore is real ppl polling.... and it came out fine....  the box office is real ppl giving their money for it and it also has come out fine... 

no it's not a perfect movie... but it's no worse than TFA or R1... i didn't like any of them but i also don't think it was worse than the prequels or the DC movies which is how some ppl think it is...  

it is outrageous and there's def fishiness going on... i trust the critics more than online polling.. esp the trolls over at imdb.... "

i'm saying the audience score that equates it with justice league, attack of the clones and suicide squad is pretty crazy....

you're saying that's normal chief? gtfo weirdo... "

you're a perfect example of this judging by your post history....  "

"this having a lower audience score than justice league and attack of the clones... is a bit much.... 

i don't care how bad you might've thought it was... some ppl are just playing too much 'monday morning armchair director' at this point... it wasn't worse than Justice League or AotC or Suicide Squad....  

get over yourselves.... "

[source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120513/how-obamacare-raising-your-taxes.asp)    

obv this got overshadowed by the aca initiative... so there is a smidge of truth in what you are saying... but i think on the whole it's a bit misleading to say that they talk big but don't deliver... it's never really been close to the #1 thing dems have focused on... and they haven't really had the opportunity to get major tax reform passed because of other priorities and they just haven't had full control all that often....

the fact that they failed fit with the entire theme of the movie so it made sense that it had no consequence but that also has the unintentional effect of it meaning nothing...  some folks preferred it to be linear and that's fine...  

we're not really disagreeing here but just providing another perspective that it can be bad but still add something to the film... kind of like ewoks in rotj... "

"i liked the world itself... i guess it was supposed to add depth and context to the story which i think it accomplished in a way... but ppl are focusing on the outcomes... which yes made it ultimately unnecessary....  

it's purpose was to connect the audience in a real world way... the horse/camel like creatures... the gambling... the kids being oppressed... war profiteers playing both sides... war is supposed to be dark and we got a sense of that... i think it could have been done better also but that was the purpose....

"no i understand completely.. there's no distinction between single payer and universal healthcare in terms of what the left wants currently... and previously for that matter.... it doesn't make a difference because there's a huge gap between universal coverage and what the aca is now...  

but being petty is a signal of someone who has no room left in their arguments... 

to sum up for you:  

yes there was a mandate mentioned in the heritage plan...  
yes that plan was taken to committee.... 
no japan never had a mandate....  
no whatever differences you think there was between the aca and the heritage/heart plans does not make it completely and utterly different....  

thanks for clarifying...

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system_in_Japan  
>Health insurance is, in principle, mandatory for residents of Japan, but there is no penalty for the 10% of individuals who choose not to comply, making it optional in practice.  

a mandate that's not enforced... is not a mandate... 

the original clinton plan was for universal health coverage... if you were to say what's the left's solution to improved health care.. they would say single payer... what would be the right's? what historically was the right's solution to health care?   

and then tell me what the aca was more similar to....  i'm still waiting... 

"
"japan never had a mandate.... 

these are not just superficial similarities... this is a democratic spin on it sure... but the key outlines were basically taken from that plan... the mandate.. purchase pools...   

historically what has the democratic solution to health care have been? it was single payer(ex. bill clinton's plan and now sanders).... so you should ask yourself is the aca more similar to single payer or the heritage/chafee plan?"

>Baucus very deliberately started the talks with a template that was the core of the 1993-4 Republican plan, built around an individual mandate and exchanges with private insurers—much to the chagrin of many Democrats and liberals who wanted, if not a single-payer system, at least one with a public insurance option. Through the summer, the Gang of Six engaged in detailed discussions and negotiations to turn a template into a plan. But as the summer wore along, it became clear that something had changed; both Grassley and Enzi began to signal that participation in the talks—and their demands for changes in the evolving plan—would not translate into a bipartisan agreement."
"i don't think anyone said it was exactly like it... but it did involve changes to medicaid and the mandate... "
"you repeat yourself because nothing what you say is actually true... everyone has provided sources and yet you deny that the aca was completely different than those things when it clearly wasn't....  "
"i'm not sure if you read the heritage plan but it does involve a mandate and reforms to medicaid.... they literally started with that plan as the template when it went into committee....   "
"'bi-partisan'... is always going to be a matter of semantics.... bipartisan to republicans is going to mean one thing and another to democrats...  

but relative to what republicans are doing currently... then yes... it is fair to say that the aca was completely bi-partisan.... "
"would it be fair to say that with a democratic super majority that major healthcare reform would not include any major republican initiatives?  

they had a chance to contribute... it started with a template from a republican plan... compared to something like single payer... that is already moving way right in an effort for good faith negotiations... that isn't good enough apparently...  "

so yes... flynn was clearly negotiating and the US was clearly having a dispute with russia at the time....   

these things do not apply to either carter or obama....  "
"again... it's not perfect.. you're not alone in your experience and i realize that.... that's why it was meant to be improved upon to make it better... there is no piece of major legislation as big as healthcare reform that goes untouched for years and years... it gradually gets added to so that it becomes better and removes some faults...  

medicare/medicaid are prime examples.. they do not exist back as it was when it was first enacted... there have been numerous adjustments and improvements to it over the years.... the ACA is basically that...  "
">private citizens are not allowed to influence foreign policy  

what flynn pled guilty to was affecting foreign policy... there was no policy being discussed in either of obama's or carter's visits.... if there was and i missed it... please cite.... "
"no i didn't... but i had friends who were between jobs who used it... and my parents and fiance's parents use it...  

there was obviously a gap in medical coverage for those with pre-existing conditions... it was meant to help them... it's not perfect but it's still a wildly popular piece of legislation... you're experience and opinion differs and that's fine... but most ppl would disagree with you in saying that it is horrible and wasn't a major accomplishment of obama's...
