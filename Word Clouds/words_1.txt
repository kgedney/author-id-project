"I hate this argument 

Yes what you said is correct, 100%. 

But it’s such a silly argument. Taxes shouldn’t be spread based on number of people, they should be spread based on amount of wealth. If 1% of people make 99% of the income, then they should pay 99% of income tax.


People who earn 1% of all income should only pay 1% of all income tax, that would be a fair system.

Yet some people insist it should be based on number of people not amount of wealth"

"I mainly know Catholic beliefs, so this isnt true of all christians 

They believe that Bible was written by people who were inspired by the holy spirit. Holy spirit = God. So they believe that the bible is the word of God, but written by people.


Well, the idea, is that all stories are meant to be important and true in different ways. They decide on the interpretation of texts through different means, and these interpretations evolve over time. My understanding is that the Holy Spirit, again, guides important religious figures in this. I.e. we know its not meant to be taken literally because the many different Pope's (guided by God) has said so, on many occasions.


Its important to note the role of the Pope and Saints in Catholicism, their teachings, while not held to the same standard of the Bible, are also, sometimes, considered to be inspired by God. "
"You've mainly talking about Christian fundamentalists. The vast majority of Christians, including Catholics, dont literally believe in the Bible. They believe the story's told are important lessons, but not that they actually happened.
Also Catholics believe in evolution and I believe 3 Popes have talked about how it integrates with Catholic beliefs. "

"Title belts are props. Yes they can have meaning, yes they can be important, but in this case, lets look at them as writing props.

Kofi won a lot of his IC and US titles during times of shockingly bad writing in WWE. Because Kofi didnt really have a character other than Face who does cool moves, he was given titles in order to create feuds around him without having to develop his character.

So in short, he was the perfect middcarder to tell easy, lazy stories with."

"Sauce: One tweet from Meltzer 3 months ago, vaguely mentioning that Roman/Taker built the future.

I'm not saying it couldn't be true, but man, a lot of people are really over selling this theory."
"Yeah, its weird. People talk about Taker being done after Mainia 30 or 31, yet between 32 and 33 he had a really good feud with good matches with Brock. 

The man just had a hip replacement, thats probably more the reason for this match than anything else."
"The point stands that he's still lost clean. Pretending otherwise is dishonest."
"No no no, Roman has never lost and is the worst booked wrestler ever /s

Its like people on this sub have the memory of a goldfish. Roman lost clean to Seth like twice in a row in the lead up to the brand split. 

He's the top guy, he's only meant to lose once or twice a year clean. Look at Cena, Austin, Hogan or Bruno."

"Roman's had a 4 star match with Big show, so yeah, he might be able to actually."
"Yep, thats why he was in a title match at RR, because the in Kayfabe the company hates him.

If they hated him, why was he in a title match last night? "
"So who does Owens fight at Maina then? Jericho? Roman and Seth are both out, name another face that can headline Maina currently on RAW. 

Owens is losing the title, and probably in a 2 minute squash."

Its a complex philosophy and just cherry-picking failed states as examples of the entire philosophy in order to discredit it is just wrong.

Imagine if you did that with every country that claimed to be a Democracy? 

North Korea is called and run by a ""Democratic"" peoples party and the country does vote in elections every year

Does that make it a Democracy?  "
"Ah yes, but you see, this is Roman Regins, we must take arbitrary  things about him, and nip-pick the fuck out of it, all because we dont like the way he's booked.

Seriously

Everyone who complains about Romans theme seems to forget that all those other tag guys got to keep their old music.

Why is it different with Roman? Maybe its got something to do with other than his fucking music or attire "
"Why?

I, along with many others, find the characters and storyline way more interesting than that of the Smackdown womens title scene. 

For whatever reason, to me at least, the Raw women feel much more important than the smackdown women, in the same way many people feel that the WWE title is much more important than the Universal title at the moment.

Thats due to booking, yes 7 title reigns is a bit much, but otherwise the women on Raw are booked as more important than on Smackdown, in my opinion."
"I highly disagree, while the 7 title reigns is excessive, I am much more invested in the Raw women's title scene than Smackdowns. And I'd be really shocked if I am the only one who thinks that.

Hence that means that the RAW booking has been more effective.

"Serious question, how would you even know it was him before he came out? Like what would his music even be?"
"So Miz is a Chump, and D-Bry, who can't wrestle again, looks good. Cool. 

Not like Stephanie at all then.


I understand what you're saying, but if someone is getting one over on the Miz it should be a face who could use a rub. Not a non-active character."
"Hence why I said Morrison in WWE. 

The guy above said he was good at WWE promos, he very clearly was not."

->John Morrison in WWE

Pick one

It was a great feud, dont get me wrong, but Morrison was not a good promo in WWE, just watch him during the R-truth heel turn. He looks to be in pain saying his lines."
"She's losing to Bayley. Thats the storyline, thats why she has that record. Bayley gets over by being the John Cena of women. i.e being the underdog and overcoming the odds.

"eh, could tell a good story. They could make it like Batista/HHH. "
"I mean, thats a little unfair?

When he beat Ziggler they played it up really big. Saying that Breeze had just beaten a former World champ etc. 

They did try with him."
"Everyone forgets that they actually tried with Breeze too. Like, he got a decent push when he first came up, and he didnt really get over to the level of that push. "
"Just you wait. WWE see Corbin as being a champ one day, thats what Dave is talking about. Corbin will be a champion and if he doesnt improve a lot, he will suck in that situation."
"Tables matches, while an interesting situation tend to just suck in nature.

In saying all that, I believe a Big Show/Regins Tables match was actually alright (ie memorable) and a Cena/Sheamus one but only cause of the finish."
"You've missed my point, Orton, Cody and Ted called themselves Legacy. They claimed to be Legacy. "

"NXT doesnt make money, at all. So only 3/8 of those are in a place where they can make the company money, and 1 of them was only on the main roaster a month. 

So 2/8 have made the company money. But if we are talking about signing indie guys to NXT, neither of those 2 were actually signed to NXT to begin with.

The idea isnt overly to make money off these guys, its to give HHH creditability as a booker and to show he can be Vince's replacement."

"While I dont agree with OP, I can his point.

D-Bry was not really a big draw in WWE for an extended period of time, which is a big thing for HoF.

He drew alright on the indies, but he wasn't the draw for the period of time that someone like Flair or HBK or Cena were. "
"Pretty sure the Rock gets one too, given how Dave's talked about messaging him recently."
"The only people in WON HoF are those who either drew really well for an extended time period (Flair/Hogan/Cena), or those who were, at one point, considered the very very best in the world at an aspect of wrestling.(D-Bry being the best technician for 10 yrs)

Thats it

Theres no middle ground on that. Its so strict that there was massive debates about Jericho going in. Fucking Jericho nearly didnt get into the WON HoF, the bar is that high.  "
"Up 18% from 2010's and 3% higher than 2012's.

So big, yes. Massive, not at all.

Not as big as Starcade(which went from 0.9mil to 1.9mil) 

I always thought that MitB was big, turns out it was only a little above average.

Though there is an argument to be made Punk drew in the UFC ironically enough."
"I mean, that sounds a little like Punk honestly. MiTB was a big buyrate, it was all him leading up to it etc.

Would you put Punk in the HOF? Because at this moment, I dont think I would."
"Context is important.

Genocide occurring = US should do something, they did promise to make sure it wouldnt happen again. (NATO intervention in Yugo=good)

"Rock had 3/5 other guys to play off and help build him

Cena had no one really apart from maybe Punk"
"The selling part is bullshit. His selling in the mens SS match was fucking great and everyone knows it. He cant carry a match, but he can hold one with AJ styles and he's only been in the business a few years.

He's not the best wrestler, he's not the best promo, he's not the best seller. But in 6 years he's gone from not knowing how to bump, to being maybe top 10 for 2/3 of those on the main roaster.

Thats impressive. He's not just fine, he's good. Not great, but good.

He went from shit to good, thats something"
"Sort of. They all kind of took turns being the leader in the Shield. It wasnt all Seth, but is wasn't all Dean either. It was all of them, at different points. I think people mainly remember Dean because he was more of the promo guy, but just because he was talking the most didnt always make him in charge."
"I mean, I would make a strong argument that Roman is probably one of the most improved over the past 2 years, in the ring, in selling, even in promos to an extent.

Thats change

Booking wise, maybe a little less has changed, but he is no longer the focus of the show.

I think its really false to pretend that Roman is the same as 2 years ago, when he's come leaps and bounds since then, and he's now booked as more of a strong side character, instead of the main focal point."
"There is. Thats why in recessions governments spend heaps of money in order to create demand, by starting new project works, etc.

In fact this creates more demand in some cases, than tax cuts. As if the gov pays to build a new highway, lots of new employees are needed. Vs a tax cut on a business where there is no guarantee of new hires."
"Until if effects someones district which some of that spending was going towards.

People support some other area losing military funding, not theres.

Thats the problem in general. "
"Isnt that a cop out? 

I presume they got moved to late time slots because of poor ratings in prime time. Not the other way around. "
"I like and understand your thinking. I just dont think that works in practice though.

Sometimes the problem is that theres 200 new jobs every week, with 500 new people looking for work each week. So the idea of helping someone get a job in their felid isnt always attainable based on practicality. Giving people more skills also doesnt help for the same reason. People are out of work because there just isnt enough of it sometimes.

So to compensate, the government gives people work to do. I know it may not be helpful for future employment, but sometimes, all people want is something to go to in the morning, something to work for. 

Either way, I do not think claiming that its a nutty idea is fair. Again the other totally is though. "
"I dont understand how you can say that the House of Reps reflects the population when Dems won the popular vote by 2mil and lost the house by a large margin.

I get thats what the house was meant for, but it is not that now. Not since the number of Reps was capped at 435.
"
"On your second point, the employment office sounds an awful lot like a ""work for the dole"" scheme. Which many nations do have. The idea is that you get people who, are able to work but are unemployed, and you pay them a very very basic wage to basically pick up rubbish, gardening and other jobs along those lines.

Tbh thats really not that nutty, and is pretty common economic policy. 

Most of the other stuff though is absolutely insane."
"I dunno, knowing he didnt like sand made him seem like hitler to me /s"
"Yep, no nukes though. 

Nukes end the world, no one fucks with nations with nukes.  "
"I mean, this all depends on what sect of christianity you follow.

Catholics believe the bible in its current form was selected and written by those inspired by the holy spirit and are thus the word of God, even if there are additions or mis-translations. 

i.e. For Catholic's, at least, it really doesnt matter if there are textual variants, as God inspired them."
"Brock was planing on fighting in the UFC and didnt want to get injured.

ie, there was more money in doing nothing with Ambrose to do a big match in the UFC instead."
"He was coming off a wellness strike and Chicago fans are smarky. "
"Its still not equivalent to Christianity though. 

Christians believe Christ was the son of God AND God himself.

"Young people overwhelming went for Clinton, it was likely middle age blue collar workers who bought the argument.

But yeah whatever, damn millennial's ruining the country, am I right? "
"She went for the kill instead of playing defence.

Her campaign was going for a landslide, trying to put AZ, GA and even texas in play. 

On top of that, she could of lost those states but won the election if she won Fl and NC, which was 100% a possibility. 

She gambled and lost"
"I think 538 giving Trump 1/3 of a chance while everywhere else wrote him off completely is telling of this fact. 

They even stated numerous times that if Clintion won the popular vote by only 1 or 2, Trump would win the EC most of those times.

In short, they didnt get every state like they normal do, but they did a damn good job with a strange election "
"Who's the blame? The voters, or the candidate that couldn't conceive them to vote for her?

Blaming a voter for not voting for your candidate, is a lot like putting the cart before the horse. The blame is Clinton and her campaign for not being able to win over those voters, its not the voters fault they didnt like/agree/trust Clinton."
"Can't tell if sarcasm or not?

Assuming its not, she lost the rust belt because of this exact mentality of thinking she could disregard those voters because she thought that Trump was enough to scare them to her"
"Yep, this very intense policy orientated campaign lead to Clinton losing because voters looked at her party platform and decided that it was too progressive /s

Seriously? This election was anything but policy, but lets blame that and not the fact that Clinton spent the campaign pissing money away in AZ instead of the rust belt. Like did no one in her campaign notice that they were down by 10 in Iowa, but up 10 in Wisconsin ?

One of those polls was going to be wrong, and she gambled on it being Iowa.

Thats why she lost, stop blaming Bernie voters for her campaigns mistakes of taking the rust belt for granted."
"They were really clever about it too. Like Taker was suspended for a few months to freshen it up, then edge would be ""injured"". It was great storytelling. "
".........Its not about who the superdelgates support, its about perception yeah?

"Because then someone can become president with only 30% of the vote. Winner by plurality is the worst form of democracy you can have."
"Im really confused why this matters much. If the majority of people live in cities/urban areas, than shouldnt they have the majority of the say? 


I ask this as a philosophical thing really. Like, should rural and urban votes be equated even though their populations are vastly different? "
"Thats my point. Countries with nukes, who are part of NATO or an alliance with a country that has nukes, will never ever be at war with one-another.

China wont attack Aus or NZ because of the ANZUS treaty they have with the US, and Aus/NZ wont attack China cause Nukes. 

OP was talking about how aus/Nz could hold off China, I was more pointing out that if it gets to that stage, the worlds probably ended. 

Hence why complaining other countries dont pull their weight in military spending is a pointless argument because if it got to the stage where it mattered, everyone would already be dead."
"You seem to lack understanding of modern warfare. 


This isn't the 30/40's anymore, some countries have nukes. Which stop other nations from fucking with them.

Europe doesnt need an army to stop Russia, they just need MAD. Countries dont need giant standing armies to protect their interests. They dont need 200 Aircraft carriers and they dont need 2 million jets. 

Also, fyi: both Aus and NZ do not have nukes while China does, so i have no idea what that Taiwan thing is youre on about, China could destroy Aus and NZ in an afternoon. And those countries can't stop it, not because their military budget isnt 3% of GDP. They can't stop it because they DONT HAVE NUKES ffs. 

Im so confused why you're under the impression that nations need to spend so much on the military. "

"We also didnt always life expectancy of 78. If you want to go back to when most people died in they're 60's, thats fine, thats your view. But lets not pretend that people where better off back then ok?"
"Its a little easier than what OP was talking about. ""Red states"" can often vote in dems at the state level. Since this is passed at the state level, its possible if theres a blue wave during a mid-term, that this could get to 270. Its already at 165, a blue wave could probably bring it to 270. "
"Yep, $20

and fyi you dont actually have to vote, you just have to have your name ticked off at a polling place. "
"It really doesnt matter one way or the other. The DNC is portrayed in a lot of peoples minds as being the organisation that takes money from big business. Whether thats the case or not is irrelevant, because people still perceive to be this way.

Putting a former lobbyist, no matter his past experience, political leanings or ideals, would only strengthen this view people have of the DNC.

I understand why many people support him, but at the end of the day, his hiring would just further the DNC's woes, no matter his strategy ideas.

"
"A billionaire who ran on the idea that he didnt need to take money from wall street, yeah? 

Like, lets not pretend Trump ran as a wall street elite, ok?

He ran as the ""blue-collar-billionaire""

Weather thats bullshit or not is irrelevant because clearly, thats what his voters saw him as. While Clinton was seen as someone who took money from wall street and was corrupt."
"Not really, dont Dems need like 53-56% of the popular vote to retake the house? "
"Its less sad in Australia though, you get fined for not voting, so if you really dont like or care, you're still forced to vote. Hence why so many penises are drawn."
"He certainly did not, he was either slightly to the left or the same, to claim otherwise is just false.

He did end up, when he was president, to the right of Clinton, but that certainly wasn't what he campaigned on."
"I totally agree. I think that the policy isn't an issue at all, they just need someone inspiring. Someone who is able to inspire 20-30 year olds and minorities to turn out. 

Clinton, while very good at other things, just simply wasnt inspiring. "
"..........2008 Obama wasnt a centrist. He ran as a mild-progressive to the left of Clinton remember? 

And he won in a landslide. In 2012 he ran as more of a moderate, but still promoting change. He still won easily. 

It seems like you just want a likable centrist. 

I think this election has shown policy doesnt matter, its all about how charismatic and the message the nominee presents, not how much to the left/right of centre the person is."
"People here seem to think Clinton lost because her policies weren't right enough. Like seriously? She lost because she pissed money away trying to put AZ in play, while forgetting to put money into the rust belt. Like, did no one in her campaign think that maybe it was a little weird she was down 10 in Iowa, but up 10 in Wisconsin? One of those polls had to be wrong, so why not make the safe bet. 


But no, she lost because people looked in-depth into her policy and thought she was too left leaning. "
"Seriously? Thats what you're going with. In an election that had almost 0 policy talk. No one knew much of the Democratic platform.


The Democrats lost because Clinton ran a campaign on ""Trump is bad"", while also disregarding her Blue wall, where she didnt campaign. 

But you dislike progressives, so yeah, it was because all Clinton did was talk about her hyper-progressive policies like Climate change."
"Yes, but why should someones voice and vote be lessened for it? The people who live in those states are as american as those who dont and they deserve an equal say in things, but they dont get that. They are lessened under a system which says they dont count as much because MORE people live in those states. Its simply insane. This goes for Texas too. Absolutely absurd that a democratic nation actually punishes more people living together in favour of more spread out voters."
"The GOP has lost the popular vote in 6/7 elections. So why would a red state vote for this? 

In short, its not happening until the Dem's control the majority of states, and thats not happening for a long time, bearing some major change."
"None what-so ever. It just highlighted how bad he was at those type of debates. If the DNC ran with him in 2020 it would be a massive mistake and this is one of the reasons why, he's not a good debater. "
"Yeah, I think a lot of people are freaking out because she lost the rust belt. She lost it by less than 1% and didn't even campaign there for christ sake. The rust belt isn't gone forever, they just picked the guy who gave them more attention, meanwhile Clinton was trying to put AZ in play."
"Maybe the 19% turnout was because there wasnt a progress to vote for? 

Im being serious, whats the alternative? Keep moving further right?


Who does that bring in? No one from business, not as long at the GOP support trickle down economics. Not millennials, they'll be even more turned off. Not the working class, they want a populist, not a centrist. Who is there left to expand into then? Clintion already won College-educated whites and minorities, but lost the election.

Where do they go from here if not progressive? At least that has a possibility of bringing millennials into the fold"
"Yep. Though it should be pointed out, if she had won NC and Florida, she would of won the election. So maybe doubling down on her strategy wouldn't be such a bad idea in the long run. She just couldn't generate the minority turnout she needed to win."
"Also, are we all forgetting that Kaine got manhandled by Pence in the debate? 

Kaine would be the worst mistake the Dems could make when rebuilding."
"Your first link is written in a really partisan way. I don't mean to totally discredit it, but it does lessen its impact. While the 2nd link just talks about how congress passed a budget ( the Highway bill seems part of that), which is the bare minimum for them to do, and the education reform, which is something though. 

The 3rd link is just saying congress passed a bunch of bills, not what was in them. And 11,000 bills seems to be dead on average for congress since the 90's by your own link. 

Also again, 11,000 bills means nothing when a party controls that house. It's  about how many of them actually become law and passed the other houses. Only 244 passed. I think thats very telling compared to any congress before 2009, where it was twice, to 3 times the amount."
"Thats a start, at least he's saying he's willing to work. The GOP has been saying an absolute no to compromise for the past 4 years, even if it was part of their policy."
"The redistricting has fucked it from ever happening. Like I think the Dems need to win the mid-terms by something between 53-56% just to edge a slim majority in the house. 

And its already been proven by this election that Dems wont turn out just to stop Trump."
"Didnt congress specifically pass a bunch of bills knowing Obama would veto them, just to use it as ammo against him? 


Aren't 1000's of those bills, bills to do things like name federal buildings?

Like, a congress stacked to one party passing bills isnt exactly impressive. Compromising with the other side to get them into law, is."
"The polls ended up being off by about 2%, less than they were in 2012. 

It wasn't the polls, it was the way the media speculated and talked about them."
"Polling was off by 2%, less than it was in 2012. It wasnt polling."
"Im not talking about passing an amendment.


There is currently a compact between 165EV's of states that says if they get 270EV worth of states votes, all states in the compact will give all of there EV's to the popular vote winner, regardless of weather they won the state or not. 

It's only Dem states atm, and if a few GOP states get on board this, then the Electoral college is pretty much render void. "
"They dont even need an amendment and they dont need all the GOP, they just need a half dozen GOP states to sign the Interstate Compact so it gets above 270."
"Seriously? 

Clinton is the incumbent party now as much as McCain was then. 

By your logic, McCain blew a bigger advantage. "
"Should be noted that Nate's been saying for weeks, he's pretty sure his model is too red leaning for Nevada due to bad polling."
"OP's point is that, of course Ohio is red while the nation is blue, because Ohio has always been slightly red leaning. The reason Republicans need Ohio to win, and Dems dont, is because Ohio is red leaning, so if the GOP loses it, it most likely has lost the election, while if the Dems lose a red leaning state, its not that bad.

Compare that with Florida which is probably the closest there is to a state with no lean."
"I mean, wasnt this basically what he did with the jericho/Brock thing. Only like 5 people were present for that, I'd be shocked if anyone other than Jericho told him the story."
"Its crazy to see just how much a third party can fuck up the US system. In this map, combine the ALP and the greens vote and the ALP wins in most states. "
"I mean, it really depends on what you class as fringe. I would make the argument that the house freedom caucus could be considered fringe and they wield enormous power."
"I mean, I totally understand you.

I just think its needs to be pointed out, that, a ""quirk"" of a stable democratic system is that, the peoples votes are not equal and every now and again, the person the people didnt vote for, gets in.

I mean

Doesnt that raise questions for you about the ""democracy"" of your nation? "
"..........Which they had to use guys pegged for the SS match in order to have a tournament. Last years SS sucked bad, but it was 100% understandable, everything on that card had to get thrown out the window apart from Wyatt/Taker, because of Seths injury."
"538, which averages all the nationwide polls, has the race within 4% actually. On top of that there are way more undecideds than 3rd party voters."
"No, I dont think that. Im just explaining how WWE books and for whatever reason, when its SD Vs RAW, SD usually wins. 

I fully expect SD to win the mens SS match, probably via fuckery or the RAW team falling apart or whatever. Its just the way they book. ""Well if SD wins via RAW fuckery then really both are equal"" . Its the 50/50 approach to booking, one team wins, but not on there own merit, so no one gets over and its even. "
"Its not OP's thinking, its WWE's. Look at the original brand split, SD won a ton of these types of matches to make it seem more ""legitimate"". Back in the original brand slpit, SD won both Bragging rights PPV's for no reason other than SD looking ""legitimate"". Its stupid and pointless and its WWE booking. 

Id be shocked if SD lost the mens match because of this. "
"Seriously, people bitching about the vest still talk about it being really thick and blah blah blah. It looks like fucking netting now. Its super slim and just looks like any other form of tights. But people still talk about it like its the same as the one he had in shield."
"No, not at all. A coin flip is random and unconrolled, WWE's booking is not. They will hot potato a belt for a while and then not change it for a long time in order to garnish prestige back on the belt. They did it with the IC belt on Cody, they did it with the WWE belt on Punk. Its the way WWE books, hence why I wouldnt be shocked if Charlotte doesnt drop the belt now till at least Mainia. "
"Seriously? It was a terrible name, but at least it made sense with fastlane and the ""road to maina"". Having Road block before RR is terrible."
"On the bright side, Im almost 100% certain no titles are being defended at it, everyones just gonna be put into the 3 tag matches. At least that seems to be the way they are setting it up. 

So next time New Day have a title match, they will have hopefully have broken the record, and will hopefully drop the belts. "
"Cool, your right, that would have been a better go home. My point is more that, Sasha and Charlotte's lack of experience and inability to improv ruined the ending as much as the table not breaking."
"Change the set-up, do a powerbomb through the table instead. 

Or change the angle of the table so thats its more vertical and more likely to break. 

Or keep pounding sasha into it until it breaks, selling Charlottes viscousness 

Theres lots they could of done and anything would of been better than doing nothing and just pretending it wasnt botched."
"2011 too, people often forget that the title changed hands like every PPV for 7 months until Punks 428 day reign. 

Thats why I dont think Charlotte winning here is bad. WWE always will have long reigns after quick title changes."
"Thats fair, but highly valuing a competent government over its policies can lead to countries doing horrible things and it being dismissed because the party in charge brought stability. "
"While thats true, its important to note that oil and gas make much greater contributions, and that there is evidence of climate change."
"Apparently he did, and that PPV did really well because of him"
"Arent those all reasons to put her on TV? She's green, the only way she'll get better at all that is by practicing it on TV."
"Because they thought it made an easy good story. I.e. Bryan gets redemption for his 18 second loss.

WWE is lazy and a story like that would be easy to tell.


Also Sheamus is booked pretty much like D-bry. He is also a ""B+"" who main-events every now and again but is never booked overly weak."

"Australians dont tip unless its really exceptionally great service."
"Ive lived in a country with compulsory voting (Australia) and Ill back up what you said.

In general, since everyone votes, single issue groups have far less influence and in general things swing more around how long a party has been in power rather than anything else.  

Who does this benefit in terms of political parties? 

I'd say neither, as low information voters tend to vote for whoever is portrayed less negatively in news coverage."
"The USSR in the very early days came close, turns out true socialism is hard to achieve.

I never said it was practical, but there is a reason that the real socialism argument exists.

In order for true socialism there cant really be a government, or even countries as we know them.

My argument is more that having the government take over industries could be more of a government power play done under the guise of socialism rather than a government committed to socialist principles.

Taking those examples and claiming that this is what socialism causes, when the government is clearly using the guise of socialism in order to gain greater influence, doesnt really hold up."

"The freedom argument is simply ridiculous

I could make the same argument about the government making a ""decision for all of us has a very high cost, in dollars and lives, and arguably in freedom"", about heroin. Do you think that should be legalised for the same reasons?

Telling them they need to try and find a different skill while they have the chance is a lot more helpful then telling them ""dont worry coal will be around forever"". "
"Thats a bit of a twist, isnt it. I think all OP was saying was that pretending coal jobs are going to last forever or even the next 20 years, isnt going to help coal-miners. They deserve to be informed that their industry is dying, not lied too and manipulated with promises that its not."

"""book as an absolute joke""

Has main-evented numerous PPV's thoughout last year, in the world title picture constantly and faced Lensar at mainia. 

Just because he isnt ""The"" guy doesnt mean he isnt booked strong for fucks sake. Dude is a main-eventer/upper-middcarder. Its not like he's Ziggler doing jobs to new NXT guys every other week, or Rusev who's having a feud with a premium guy.

"They are all shit names that just sound 90's, that would only generate interest in an audience that they already have and not create any new fans. Like a kid or teenager hearing the name ""Bash at the Beach"" or ""in your house"" would think it sounds lame as fuck. No new fans there. And the over 30's who were into wrestling in the 90's aren't going to come back because the names are back. Why? Because theres about 20 hours of content a week to watch that just makes people turn off.

But its a great idea because it gives very select fans (most of whom are already watching) a nostalgia boner. Fuck trying to create new fans or generate interest in groups who dont have 90's nostalgia."

"That stat is useless, a 5 min title reign isnt really a fucking reign now is it? Like theres a reason it doesnt feel like Roman isnt a 3 time champion, he never held the belt for any amount of time during his reigns.


Rollins has held the Title for the longest amount of time more so than the other guys in the shield combined. He defended it more too. 


"
"Rugby is popular in Europe, South Africa and the Pacific. 

Like really popular 

It is like the #6th most watched sport on Earth 

I find it really hard to understand why the US seems so resistant to it. "
"In a similar vein, its hard to see guys like Big Show or Kane or even Mark Henry being on anything now-a-days"
"This is currently the biggest problem with the club and Wyatt family

no one can really join them because these stables are built around one guy "
"Ok

Just because you personally dont think he's main-event, doesnt actually effect the way he's booked.

Its not like he's KO or Wyatt yeah

Like both those guys arent main-eventers yet, why? Because they arent in main-event feuds and arent in main-event matches. 

Just because Ambrose doesnt win in the main-event does not discount the fact he's still fucking main eventing. All the former shelid guys are main-eventers, thats the point.

Your problem is you're comparing Ambrose to Lensar (who beat the streak) and Cena/Regins, the TOP faces on the company. The TOP face will always be in the main-event, but that doesnt mean they are the only main-eventers."
"Ambrose isnt a main-event guy?

He main-evented like 4 fucking PPV's last year and was THE main event guy between RR and Maina when Regins was out. He had a fucking match with Brock at maina. Fuck off with this myth that somehow Ambrose isnt positioned as being in the main-event. 
"
"MiTB is to Summerslam, what the Royal Rumble is to Mainia. Its were all the big Summer feuds begin, it really is an A level PPV and has been for years now."

"Why would the government ever try and find the living relatives of someone if they get the land and money if none are found?

"Champagne. Everyone will go out and buy it for special occasions, but when the glasses are filled, most will still be full by the end of the night.

Why? Because Champagne tastes like shit."
"Being the Champ doesnt mean your the best. Big show is by no means a ""great"" wrestler, and Roman had a 4 star match with him."
"I would bet all the money that Dany does not get to Westeros this season."
"And thats why the show failed.

It was a sports show for a global audience in which the hosts all lacked insight into any sport baring American football and even that wasnt great insight.

Like, most people watch sports shows because they want to see the hosts insight into it. A show where the hosts lack this seems to miss the entire point of having a sports show. "
"yeah, people dont get this. Like they could of talked all sport like Tennis, cricket, Rugby, Soccer, etc. You know, like the worlds most popular sports. But no, all they did was talk about American Football which is only really popular in one country. That would of been fine, but there audience is global, so talk about the global sports, not fucking American football."
"Flair was the first wrestler to get that type of send off, to then go and wrestle again. Seems like a kick in the teeth really. He was given the greatest send off in history, like no one ever got before and then he went and wrestled again."
"I think a former World champion with that gimmick has a bit more reality and legs to it over 2 former tag champs who never did anything of note and a Diva who also never achieved much.

Having Ziggler talk about how at one point he was the top guy, he knows what it means to be the best and you arent the best blah blah blah would actually have more weight behind it and be more believable than Justin Gabriel doing it."
"I mean, politics is all a show anyway now with the media cycle and what not. Like theres a reason Trump won the nom."
"They were not open about it with Bryan at all. It was only nearly a year after it happened that they opened up about it. For ages they never even said what Bryans injury was.

You are correct about the producer. This article states he has been in second place a while and its a race between him and kimmel with Fallon way ahead."
"I dont know if its lazy writing, its fucking hard to write about characters every single week, twice a week even, forever. Every other show, book or movie gets an off period where they can long term plan where they want a character to be at, WWE doesnt have this. "
"I dont think its stupid to view pragmatism as a bad thing. I think the logic is that she changes her views based on trends and that you want more of a leader with strong principles, instead of one whose principles change at opportune moments.

Im not saying Hillary is that, but a lot of people see her in this light, and if you were one of those people, you could never vote for her"
"I think SS 15 can get some sort of pass, like half the roster was out injured and half the PPV were matches thrown together in order for the storyline to make sense."
"""how much human activity has caused""

Yes

The debate is whether its a large amount of it or a massive amount of it.

What can be done to solve it is a political debate based around funding and tax ect. The scientific answer is simple. Stop cutting down carbon sinks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Over 40% dont though yeah? 

Like thats a large chunk of the party that thinks Sanders issues and stances were more important, to ignore that much of your base is simply insane.

The party must move to some of Sanders positions or at least pretend to if they want to unite the party and bring those 40% back into the fold."
"What about non-Democrats? 

Sanders seems to have won an awfully large group of young unaffiliated first time voters. They are the ones that might just stay home because they dont have and dont like the idea of party loyalty."
"That is not a given

Wouldnt it make more sense to put money into races you actually believe you can win, rather than throwing money away for a candidate  with 0 chance and then hope people vote down ticket the way you want? Like why not just cut the middle man and fund directly the down ticket candidates where you can actually make a difference."
"If they dont like Trump, they'll either back Clinton or spend all their money on down ticket races to ensure the GOP still control both houses. They aren't going to put their money into a no hope cause."
"The model wasnt wrong, you just dont understand how models work. If there's a 9% chance he wins and he wins, it shows it was an upset. Which this 100% was. "
"The cell match was a punishment. When they gave him the WHC he was asked to dress like a champ, he said Cena didnt so why should he. For that they took the title off him in an opening squash match."
"Roman didnt even kick out of 1. 3 of them happened outside when AJ wasnt able to pin him and the one he did pin him on was the rope break. 
"
"On top of this Cena really helped put over Owens. Owens lost the feud, but he beat Cena in his first match, it was massive."
"AJ won twice and commentary was putting him over like crazy, saying whoever hit the next big move would win and it was a toss-up. This whole main-event was booked to protect both AJ and make Regins retain."
"If thats the case why would she be so against having them out there?

Like I totally understand the idea that they were nothing boring speeches, but if thats the case, why doesnt she just show the public?

This is more of a people just wanting political transparency more than a conspiracy against Clinton. 
"
"Wasnt this basically Ortons gimmick and how he originally got over?"
"ADR

He should of been a face from the start and WWE want a big mexican draw"
"Stalin was responsible for the deaths of upwards of 10 million Russians due to starvation and random killings.

Russia was part of the Allies and arguably the most important factor in winning the war."
"That depends

You forget that Russia was part of the allies and that stailn massacred over 10 million of his own people by deliberately starving them, this was not an act of war."
"Depends on your definition of Good and Evil I suppose. Both sides committed horrible things, but theres the notion of Germany started it, so its their fault. WW2 is very complicated and its very narrow minded to claim it was good Vs evil.

Like dictators are seen as evil today, but during this time, there was a real belief that dictatorships where the best form of government and theres some points for that ( and a lot against too) "
"""mexicans are rapist"" comes to mind

The context wasnt him being overtly racist, but its a dog whistle that appeals to people who are racist. They hear him say that line and it seems like he's winking yeah? Like ""I love mexicans, some of them are rapists though"" The rapist part is the most important part of that sentence, not the I love mexicans part.

Same with his refusal to come out against the KKK leader. He did later, both only after people where aware he hadnt. Again another dog whistle as he's letting people know he's ok with the KKK and is only coming out against them because the ""PC culture"" is making him, yeah? "
"If the democrats want to retain young voters, they need to give them something to support. Caps on college fees, employment programs, campagin finance reform, something new that young voters have been clamouring for. Otherwise many of Berine's supports (40%ish of this primary) wont be around come Nov."
"Want EY like Kayfabe mentally handicapped twice? I get he was a world champ at one point, but they put him in really stupid storylines."
"What?

Corporations pay a much lower set of taxes then people. 

Tax their profit at income levels and then you'd have a case, but when corporations are treated with much much nicer tax levels then a person its dishonest to claim they are taxed like people."
"Oh, yeah, he is well with-in his right to give an opinion on it. I was just trying to explain why some wouldnt take to kindly to it.


Again thats valid, but a lot of the time, these responses come when a US figure says something like, healthcare/gun-control/social program X, doesnt work and that Uk/Sweden/Aus is a hell hole because of it. Even though its blantantly false. Its like the rest of the western world responding to lies and propaganda against them. When half the US seems to genuinly believe that healthcare/gun-control fucked up the county X, when it actually improved it, dont be shocked when people from that country say otherwise."
"Theres a bit of a difference between saying, ""hey these things worked for us and every other western nation, maybe you could give it a try"" and saying, ""In this unique situation not faced before, I believe X should be your choice, based on X reasons"" 

yeah? 

Like one is saying a fact and one is stating an opinion based on fact. I think its that distinction thats important, as stating a fact isnt as intrusive."
"3 and a half nations out of 192 use metric. I think saying the world in this capacity is correct. "
"I mean, everywhere on earth barring the US and like 2 other nations use the metric system. Im not sure on 24 hour time though."
"The last part of your comment is purely subjective. All I'm saying is that they may have voted together 93% of the time, clearly, the 7%  they didnt, clearly mattered to 40% of people yeah? Like 40% of people agree more with with one, than the other. Which means its their differences that matter most.

Like 40% not voting for Clinton is a massive minority. And they should have their voice heard. Now it very clearly should not dominate her views or whatever going forward, but those 40% should be catered to in some fashion. If they didnt, and the party just said fuck you to 40% of their voters, how could those 40% be expected to take part in november."
"Its important to remember that if the nominee gets 60% of primary votes, then 40% of people didnt vote for them. Thats a pretty large minority that the nominee and the party have to get on there side. Thus influencing the party plateform is a way for this to occur, so the party is united come november."
"I mean

Sanders is winning young under 30 voters by like 70% or something. Clinton is winning over 65 voters by 70%. In the next 4 years, there will be more of those young voters and less of those old. 

Its not completely removed from reality to suggest that in 4 years time there could be a progressive shift in the democratic party."
"They just tried to vote in a consistent way. It didnt work, what else can they do now? "
"Thats why every week they mention very specific State sports teams for heat. /s"
"I would as argue Fandango is not over, his music is. And I mean Zack ryders gimmick was getting cheered, but once his match would start no one cared much unless he won."
"And Goldberg, and Rusev, and even Curtis Axle to an extent. Like squash matches are important in demonstrating to the audience this guys place on the card. Neville came in and beat Barrett in a somewhat competetive feud, and lost to seth, a main-eventer, thus he's established as being this premium/midcard guy.


Same with KO, beat Cena then lost to Cena, He's shown as being upper-midcard/main-event type level and he's been booked that way since."
"Seriously, just go see the top posts of this sub. Theres a gif of Regins doing a no look fist bump and all the comments are about how awesome Regins is."
"Can you imagine if Punk played second fiddle, in a maina main-event to Rock/Cena? He would of become a joke. Punk hadnt cut the pipebomb yet, he was hot, but not the white hot he was for MiTB at this time.

Honestly it should of been Punk/Cena at 28, but then we wouldnt of got once in a lifetime."
"I dont know how less homelessness is caused by Taxing Homeless people, they arent homeless by choice to avoid taxes you know?"
"Sorta like Orton I suppose?

Though Orton probably is more Main-Event/Upper midcard"
"Honestly there is something to be said that some guys are punished more than others in other ways. Like Rey and Hardy were suspended and then put on the same position on the card when they came back. But when Swagger was suspended that was it with him really."
"Dont forget RVD and Swagger. Both Main-eventers at them time with RVD being the WWE and ECW champ"
"I mean, Rubio had one bad debate and it ended his presedental chances.

And Jeb had poor debate showings and look what happened to him.

To suggest debates rarely shift the needle is incorrect."
"I mean..............do you listen to Tea party Republicans? 

I get they arent everyone, but when a large percentage of the base says these horrible things, then is it a wonder that people associate conservatives with them?
"
"I agree, thats why I dont fully agree with the whole system is rigged thing. Yes Hillary has moved left because of the primary. 

Im just explaining why some do think it is rigged.

Your whole life youre told that democracy is about the will of the people, and that voting is a way to get your voice heard.

Then you find someone you believe in, you make your voice heard and the system makes it so that voice isnt important because youre part of the 10% of people who arent in the majority. 

Thats unfair to many and that isnt what Democracy is meant to be. Again, thats the only way for a Democracy to function in reality. But the idea that if 10% believe in one thing, that 10% should be represented is simply not, and never can be the case.
Thats why people are angry.

You may not agree, you may not fully understand, but thats how many young first time voters feel."
"While you're 100% right, I think its important to note, that while Sanders is losing, he still has gained around 40-45% of the vote. That means that 40-45% of democrats believe in his message and what he's saying. Those 40-45% believe if Clinton wins, their sizable minority will have zero voice in government. Something about that just seems fundamentally unfair to many people. That in many ways is the ""corrupt system"" that Sanders supporters talk about."
"I mean, he is in the top heel stable. Like I know this sub doesnt like sheamus or Del Rio, but they are both former world champs, and have always been booking in the upper-midcard/main-event."
"Neither was Cena up until the last 4-5 years or so.

Like Remember the awful promo he cut before his Royal Rumble win?

He's improved greatly since then, and that was only what 4 years ago?"
"I mean, you make a comparision to a super bowl yeah?

What changes after that?

The season ends

So its not like things are mixed up or anything

The best way to watch Maina is to view it as a season finale 

Because thats pretty much how its always been booked.

Storylines end, some are happy so arent, sometimes it ends on a cliff hanger, sometimes it doesnt

This was an underwhelming season finale, but its been an underwhelming season.

You kinda got to remember that last year's maina ending was an exception, not the rule."
"The original comment disagrees with that. If the states resources belong to all citizens, that is not capitalism. "
"No, its not.

One of the fundamental ideas of socialism is that, the means of production are owned by the proletariat.

The states resources belonging to all citizens fills this.

If the citizens go nothing, that would be capitalism.   "
"The copper just makes them seem like such a third tier championship because every other belt is big and golden. "
"Reddit is very pro-gun, but its also pro campaign financing reform, while being anti-immigration but also being pro-choice. Its anti-PC which is normally attributed with the right too.

Reddit is an interesting mixed bag, but to claim Reddit has a hugh liberal bias is simply false, and I would make a very strong argument that on a world scale, Reddit is actually very slightly right leaning."
"A candidate that didnt run in the primary would be terrible for the GOP. The person could be painted as a puppet for the establishment and be without a mandate from the people. This also opens a Trump 3rd party run, again terrible for the GOP."
"Many of Sanders supporters are not part of the party and may very well just stay home in the general. What she really needs is for Sanders to actively campaign for her in the general, and that wont happen if she goes negative now. "
"He's trying to move the party back to the left, I mean, thats a perfectly vaild reason, US politics has been shifting right for 20 years, he's trying to shift it back.

And what better year to do it in? When the GOP is too busy tearing itself apart to stop it."
"Yes, but they arent a major part of the party and are meant to and tradionally act in a non-partisn way. My point is that the agenda is not set by the PM, like the original comment was suggesting"
"No, no its not, thats not how that works.

Most parliamentary systems have a independent or neutral speaker who allows both sides to introduce bills.

I actually dont know of any country other than the US that has the speaker of the house as a major position within a political party."
"The match was set up in a RAW controlled by Shane, Im guessing AJ has to defend his #1 contendership or someone else is added to the mix.

Dont see anything to do with Bullet club happening though, like they have been teasing it as Balor club for like 3 months, why would the Balor club help out AJ to be WHC when Balor is the leader?

Hope im wrong though."
"You mean like the ""Balor"" club they keep talking about in NXT? "
"He came across as a symbol, an agent for change, not a politician. In many ways he was and in many ways he wasnt, but he did not campaign around his vast political experience like Hillary does.

I honestly think thats her biggest problem with young voters, young people dont want an experenced politician because they dont trust them, they want someone who comes across as an outsider."
"I think to older demographics the idea of a politician is still a respectable person to follow, who inspires through their professionalism, kinda like Regan and to an extent Bush sen.

Younger people do not have this view  "
"Passion is a foreign concept in politics, so when supports are actually passionate about a candidate they are painted as a cult.

I think thats the differences in this election, both Trump and Sanders supporters have passion that Clinton supports dont have. "
"She just comes across as such a politician, and no person under the age of 35 is inspired by a politician. "
"You understand all heels lose yeah?

Guys like Edge and Jericho have built fantastic careers out of losing.

I do think Bray Wyatt is used to put over part-timers way too much, but Wyatt losing to Cena in a hot feud would turn out better for him then him not feuding at all with top level guys."
"Eh, im betting something major happens at RAW tomorrow, it bassically has to because apart from Y2AJ, theyve run out of storylines"
"Yeah, and isnt the whole Shane thing based around the fact the company is garbage under HHH?"
"Ive lived in Europe and Australia, Democrats are a center-right party, true and true.

From a world perspective, or at least a western world one, American politics as a whole has shifted very much to the right over the last 20-30years."
"Seriously 09 was actually interesting with Jeri-show, DX and legacy in the tag scene. The tag titles became important and were always held by main-eventers as an excuse to have them on both shows.

Then the hart dynasty won them, WWE forgot how to push them, and the tag titles fell into the under-card again."
"something something, big states control little states, something

Seriously the electoral college is a relic from the past and has outlived its function.  "
"What? The ARMBAR has had a ridiculous amount of build for a nothing match. Seriously, its had more build than the US title match by leaps and bounds "
"I think you are missing something here though.

The talent was super super thin back then, they had no one who could main event past Cena, Punk and like Kane. The idea of giving Punk the belt and not making him main event, was that it would artificially create roster depth. As Cena could face anyone and it wouldnt matter because it would be a main even match, and then Punk could face the other upper-middcarders/main-eventers, at any point on the card, and because he held the title, it would still be a pesudo main-event. That way every PPV had at least 2 important matches on them, event though they really only had the roster depth for 1 important match tops. 

Like, people arent joking when they say Punk carried the company on his back for those 434 days."
"I doubt it, for the simple fact that the Tea party grew so much due to the fact that many tea party members got congressional seats. Sanders isnt helping or promoting any left wing congress members. On top of that, the tea party gained a lot of influence from fox news, again there isnt really an equivalent on the left of this. 

In short, at worst, many left wing supports will just turn off from the election. Unlike in the GOP where they have become a frenzy due to fox news and tea party members stirring them up. Hence you have Trump, the embodiment of this."
"I mean, yeah, but Punk was kinda right? Punk was in an upper-midcard storyline at the time and JTG wasnt even on TV. 

Like it would be like in KO squashed a matadore. It wouldnt make much sense if he didnt.  "
"By reading their financial breakdowns?

They made a fuck ton of money last year.

Like just because it isnt as main stream as it once was doesnt mean they arent making a lot of money."
"Raising taxes does not make someone left of centre, Regan raised Taxes was he also left of centre?"
"Good economic policy isnt socialism 

Like the idea that trickle down economics works has shown to be false and saying so doesnt make you a socialist. 

Other than that, I actually have no idea what she's changed her view on. Like I guess she talks more about how the system isnt fair, but not really more than that."
"Really?

Isnt she basically campaigning on continuing Obama's policies?

And Obama is a centrist. "
"Arent they held during the day when normal working people cant attend? 

Like that favours both the elderly and students because they can spend a lot of time during the day doing stuff other than work, and even some students cant due to study commitments. Meaning the elderly seem to benefit most from it as they have next to 0 work or study commitments during the day"
"I hate when people say this. Tuner media was done with it because it was losing a fuck ton of money and was only still going because Ted refused to pull it. Any other network would have pulled it years before that, why? Because it lost a fuck ton of money.

Like WWE was profitable, WCW wasnt, how is that not being beat? The end goal is the most successful company/brand. The one worth the most value, and WCW from 1999 onwards wasnt that. They lost, get over it and stop pretending they were screwed   "
"seriously, why is this even up for debate. He faced Cena and Taker in maina main-events.


Cesaro was in the ""everyone gets a pay day BattleRoyal "
"Everyone says this, but did you forget how good Kalisto's last ladder match was? 

Seriously, it was one of the greatest ladder matches of the past 10 years, imagine if they used that as a selling point for him in a ladder match at maina?

It would make more sense and be more hyped than Kalisto/Ryback, which while good, wasnt nearly as good as the Ladder match. "
"Its ceremonial now, but the GG has the power to dismiss the PM and dissolve the parliament and block any bill from becoming law.

Just because the GG doesnt exercise this power often, doesnt mean he loses this power. 

Thats why I made the comparison of presedent, in terms of the person who wields the most power in the country, its the GG. Does he wield the power in the same way the US presedent does? Far from it. But the PM can not veto laws or dissolve parliament. "
"I understand what you are saying and in reality, yes the PM can do that. 

I was mainly taking issue with the fact that you equated the PM to a president or an executive branch.

The Governor-Genreal is Aus version of a president and the one who wields similar power, not the PM  "
"I mean, technically the PM doesnt have the power to dissolve the parliament, that power resides with the GG and can only be used under strict circumstances.


I understand what youre getting at, but youre framing it like the PM can dissolve the parliament whenever he wants. Which is simply untrue. 


On top of that, these double-dissolutions are quite rear.

"
"Now it is

5 years ago No way out (the then in-between PPV) set up maina, I think it was easier to do with 2 belts though, as there was uncertainty about which belt the RR would choose."
"I hear this sub talk about this all the time, but all I can think is that Jeff Hardy got the Hardy Boys music and he kept the hardy boys look and no one has ever complained about that.

But they do with Regins, why? 

The vest looks cool and the entrance is unique and over so why wouldnt you give him that?

Like seriously, I dont like Regins at all, but the one thing I do like about him is his look and entrance "
"Even Sanders is more of a moderate left compared to other western nations while the GOP would be considered fringe Right."
"That Survivor Series had 2 weeks of build due to Rollins injury and had something like 3 scheduled matches.

Roadblock actually got a good build and had good matches throughout the night. Something Survivor series seriously lacked.

The crowd was dead by the main-event when Roman won due to the poor show.

Was he over at the time? 

No not really

But that crowd reaction wasnt all his fault, it was an average end to a terrible PPV."
"Again an unfair comparison, Survivor series was the worst WWE event last year. 

Roadblock had some good moments at least and the crowd was hot."
"Reddit is not ""far left"" reddit is at best slightly left of centre in general.

"Yeah, but they needed something to break-up over, and the new day fit those roles."
"Specifically the New day turned Tweener after Fastlane so they could feud with LoN and Y2AJ at the same time, continuing 2 storylines"
"Oh yeah, I totally agree, unless theres some massive shift he's not winning, I just think its unfair to claim Clintons already won in states yet to vote.

"Yeah, just like when polls said she would win Michigan by ~20% last week?

Those states votes arent in, just wait and see how everything plays out"
"Because most costal regions being underwater is a pretty big negative and hard to see a positive side too, especially when you consider most of humanity lives around these costal regions.

"While I agree with your arguments mostly, I would argue that being the first lady for 8 years and then sectary of state for 4 years, despite the little she did in those roles, is still more executive experience than being a major of a small town, if only for the simple fact thats she's been in the inner workings of the Washington executive "
"Ideally yeah. The main event scene needs heels fast and Orton and him are really the only ones thatll turn. "
"Out of the top guys (Cena, Brock, Taker, Regins, HHH, Orton, Rollins, Ambrose) only 1 is a heel. 

Out of the midcard, only Owens is a strong heel, with the LoN acting as heels I suppose.........I mean, they fight in useless tags so.......I guess theyre the other main card heels? 

The majority of the undercard is where all the heels are. 

The company has 2 fucking heels, I think its the general view that they need more."
"Everyone gets seaside views :D 

Seriously though, there arent many positive outcomes outside of the English getting a longer summer in there underwater houses. "
"I think he's been offered before, but he doesnt do it because he's a journalist and reviewer. By working for a company he is meant to be reporting/reviewing it compromises his integrity because it raises a conflict of interest.

"I mean his idea on universal healthcare and taxing the 1% are things most other successful modern western nations do.

His education plan on the other hand has been proven not to work and there are better ways to reduce student debt and his plan on improving infrastructure is simply crazy."
"Why are you assuming Kasich voters would go to Rubio or Cruz? My understanding is that the people voting for Kasich are doing so because they are specifically anti-Rubio/Cruz and think Trumps nuts. 


If Kasich wasnt in the race, his supports would more likely stay home than vote Rubio and especially Cruz."
"His goal was to become president and he failed that goal.

Sure he did really well, but he still failed."
"I think the arguement is that the bias is a natural one, caused by the majority of the sub having that bias and therefore its fine.

"Just because someones a douche doesnt mean their view and opinion on things is invalid and its sad some people feel that it is."
"Thats why Bray wasnt in the match and didnt lose

He seems to have some pull

His family on the other hand has become the Jobber family and it sucks"
"AJ/Owen/Jericho for the IC

AJ going for his first win

Jericho going for a record 10th

Owens protecting his prize

Would be such a good match"
"From a match stand point, sure. From a storytelling standpoint? Not so much. Mania is the next PPV and at the moment we only know one match. I couldnt even guess the rest of the card."
"Rematch at maina, but its an elimination tag and the Wyatts pitch a shut out.

Only thing I can possible think off, but even then, this was a shitty way to set that up"
"The middle of the PPV turned into a really average Raw.

A 6 man tag with Bigshow and Kane, R-Truth Vs Axel, and a talk show interrupted by the New Day.

All that was on PPV "
"I dont understand the US. The government is shit and never gets anything done, but its also Repressive?

It can be one or the other, not both."
"Great point, I dont see it happening though, as it damages Regins to be less of a babyface than Ambrose would be in that situation.

And something something keep Roman strong."
"That is a wonderful way to describe it, very insightful

I think I grasp why some many people here are anti-Hillary better now.

Im Australian and dont overly care (though a right-leaning america is terrible for my country), so Ive been having trouble trying to work out why Hillary is so hated here. This really helps "
"No, but changing your mind/stance on an issue at an opportune moment can be a good quality a world leader has"
"So she's pragmatic? 

Dont you want a pragmatic leader who makes the best strategic choices for the nation, especially in times of crisis?

(Not a hillary supporter, just curious)  "
"nah

Cant have Ambrose turn heel before maina, because then logically it should be Regins/Ambrose at maina not Regins/HHH. And turning Ambrose heel to feud with anyone other than Regins wouldnt make sense really.

Itll be the start of a heel turn though, a slow build one, for after maina."
"Ambrose has never held the title

Regins has already been crowned Twice

If WWE want the underdog story, Ambrose is the choice

In saying that, Regins could be in a really good revenge for taking his title storyline for maina

But WWE for one reason or another, seems reluctant to book something like that."
"Cheating to beat Taker at Maina, outside of that, not much else. 

The problem is the only way for most fans to boo him he needs to do something the fans think is wrong, and screwing Regins would just get him cheered."
"Yeah, towards the end, but sometimes the chamber would change/set things up. Just look at the 2010 one, both champs lost and it set up the 3 maina main-events because of it.

People sometimes forget this stuff and tend to remember only the most recent ones which werent great."
"Serious question: Then why vote for a party very clearly against social progression?"
"I mean that, or his source was intentionally vague when describing it to him?

Like imagine if it ends up being AJ, then Dave looks like an idiot and loses his credibility, so I dont think he was being intentional vague saying that, he clearly has some idea or has been told something.

I know this sub likes to discredit him, but he isnt wrong often. He called the Punk thing the day after it happened, he called the screwjob like a week afterwards. He even called the Rock not being able to Wrestle at maina again 2 years ago after maina 29. 

This isnt stuff he was vague on, he was pretty detailed in all of it, and then it came out months/years later he was right at the time."
"I mean, his economic policies are pretty much in line with most other Western Nations policies though, at least from my understanding. 


I think its important to note that to many in other parts of the world, America's current economic theory is disturbing, and Sanders is sane. 

Since the GFC there has been a renewed push for keynesian economics, the type Sanders pushes. And the Depression proved it worked then. "
"Thats an interesting point of view, but is ultimately flawed as that is not the way it was intended to be thought of. If it was then the SCOTUS or the POTUS would of been given the power to review legislation on constitutional grounds before it became law.


Its perfectly fine to view it that way, but its important to realise that this is not way it was intended to be viewed.

Its like watching Harry Potter and thinking Voldemort is the good guy. Its an interesting way to interrupt it, but not the intended way."
"Its conclusion, when it changed into a CM Punk stable for some reason and the half the people left to form the CORE a shitty version of it?

Com'on man, thats a classic"
"He's a 5 time IC champ

5 TIMES, thats more than kofi had.


So in short barret wrestled 5 times "
"Owens used an eye-rack against Ryback in his IC match, and Ziggler just won a match on RAW using the ropes for leverage "
"He could of lightly bladed before the match, let it heal slightly and then used his fingers to bust open the wound"
"In all fairness we thought the republicans were a joke when Regan was in charge, a b-list actor president trying to enact the Star Wars program, I mean come on, thats so absurd its funny."
"I think you're missing the point though. 

Like theres a reason he's running as Jeb! and not Jeb Bush. He knows the Bush name hurts him. If the Bush name helped he would be pushing it to the forefront. Like Clinton is."
"If they still have 3 on Super tuesday, then Trump has the nomination, its that simple "
"Taking advice from a war criminal isnt exactly good foreign policy."
"I left wrestling before his face turn and when I came back I didnt actually believe he was ever face. Like really? They turned THAT guy face? He's a good heel because he comes across unlikeable, I cant even imagine him as a face."
"Again revenue does not equal profit. I don't know how much the network costs, but this article is suspiciously lacking anything regarding profit and only talks in revenue. Yes the company is making a lot of money, but the question becomes, how much are they spending? And this article lacks this info. So these numbers, while they sound really strong, are meaningless without seeing the other side. "
"In the last couple of podcasts he's also hinted that he taked him into the last test."
"Super Tuesday could make or break Sanders and Clinton. If it goes too much one way or the other.
And it could finish the republican nom, as if Trump wins Super Tuesday, he's pretty much won."
"Yeah

but he retired today

Wrestlemaina 30 was nearly 2 years ago."
"Yeah, its not like him or even the Wyatts in general are jobbing to Ziggler or Neville or anyone else in the midcard. They lose to Regins, Taker and Lensar, but beat everyone else. They are quite clearly being protected and are in a really good spot. They are higher and more protected than KO for example. But mostly for people here have a mentality of its main event or nothing."
"All the top heels are injured (mainly Seth Rollins, but also Sheamus)

so

HHH is the last one standing really"
"They do book him consistently though.

He consistently beats mid card guys and then loses to main event guys.

Like thats who WWE want him to be. Top of the midcard away from the main event.

I get that people think he should be in the main-event, but honestly WWE is very consistent with him, and they havent tried to make him some super monster and then dropped the idea. They've always booked him this way."
"Its a good movie. But the actual battle was not epic at all....more of a skirmish that the Red coats dominated."
"dont forget Finn now too. 

hey guys....I think WWE has an injury problem"
"And if Ambrose went down it'd be Ryback, Ziggler or AJ.

Seriously, just go down the Kayfabe tier list and the next guy down is the one they'll push, its not complicated. 

Thats the problem. Injuries should shake things up, but in the end its business as normal just when midcard babyface #3 instead of #2"
"They erased Hulk Hogan, a wrestling icon, one of, if not THE highest drawing men of all time.

Everyone can be erased, everyone can be forgotten"
"No one is bigger than WWE or can change it by themselves. They need support and help from others, no one is irreplaceable and if you believe otherwise you havent been paying attention to WWE."
"He was kinda a heel in 2011 against Punk and against Cena too in 2010 "
"Its working too, kids love Ambrose, and he's got an awful lot of merch because of that.

He wouldnt be making nearly as much in merch sales if he was bloodied and bruised, violent Ambrose"
"In all fairness, HHH is normally a Heel, Heels dont tend to lose in non clean matches"
"1/12th the writers actually

28 Vs 2

I wonder if that tells you something "
"In Australia, for 200 hundred years each of the 6 aussie states governed themselves and answered to no one except the Queen who was half the world and a 6 month trip away, so yes they do have that. They couldnt even work out a standard rail width between states they were that decentralised and independent from one another. It could be argued they have a longer history of self governance as the USA form much faster from the original colonies than Australia did. (1776 Vs 1901) 

I think the holdover in the USA is more to do with the fact the country never properly healed after the civil war. I could be wrong, but thats the only conclusion ive come up with."
"Then the title is still irrelevant. OP is talking about making the IC relevant by doing IC vs WHCWWE champions. 

Saying its building Dean, while true, is an argument against OP's claim."
"It was never going to be sting though

It was Taker/Brock III and then after HiAC it was changed to Cena Vs Taker....which would of been fucking epic.

I have no idea who could take Taker now."
"I think your missing my point. It doesnt matter that it is to winnow the herd, it should still be democratic, as this is a democracy. There is nothing democratic about delegates and coin flips deciding outcomes like this. Its an old outdated, undemocratic system, that is only still in place because there is a lack of political will to change it."
"Under American presidential voting thats the case too.

The systems fucked in all sorts of ways"
"Kalisto/Del Rio in a Mask/Hair match. That could help sell out the stadium to mexican/latinos living in Texas."
"You're right. He headlined in a match with Rock. Only Cena, Punk and Miz have done that in the past decade. Thats something of how he was pushed."
"In all fairness theres only been 9 Ironman matches in WWE, and 2 were 15min ones, while 2 others were 30min ones.



It really seems that THE next ""great"" pair WWE have will be in the next one. i.e. the next Orton/Cena pair. Who wrestle a million times at the top of the card and then end the feud in the ironman match.


So yeah

Probably be Ambrose and Rollins in it. Or Regins and Rollins "
"Watching the Daniel Bryan debut brings back those awful memories of heel Cole, whose gimmick was he hated twitter. People complain about commentary now, but those were the real dark years."
"nah, he was kidnapped once

And then he killed a guy

If thats not a push then...............guys, I think TNA's fucked"
"The fact they have lost nearly every main-eventer barring Regins and can still go on is a testament to that."
"Never said he was, just that its been reported that current Reigns/ Lesner isnt on the books."
"Oh god, the Now way out in 2010 I think, where both the titles changed hands and HBK/Taker was set up was so perfect and what that PPV should be. A continuation and solidification of the angles that started at RR. And the Chamber was a perfect way to do that."
"I agree with this to an extent, but will say Meltzer has hinted a couple of times that Lesnar/Reigns is going to be after WM at the may ppv or summerslam, not before"
"Its too wacky comedy acts going against each other, it makes the whole thing seem weaker.

Jericho either needs to become more serious or new day does, because 2 unserious groups in a feud together does not make me in any way interested or invested in the story. 

In saying this I am hoping that the cringy stuff is in there for an easy heel turn in the future, where the fans are already annoyed at him."
"Honestly it gets tiring that in every single thread on this sub, someone always finds a way to shit on Roman Regins, we all get it, you dont like the guy, its almost become a competition of who can bring him up in the most obscure ways.


I'm not saying never bring him up, I'm saying is it so hard to talk about him in the 50 other threads designed to talk about him, and not the ones that just have nothing to do with him.


Thats why this meme formed, to parody this.  


If people feel the need to obscurely bring up Reigns that dont be shocked when others find a way to obscurely bring up a ""tired meme"" "
"It was shoehorned in and was obnoxious, how does Roman Regins being bad at promos factor into a thread about Tyler Breeze being sidelined? 

answer it doesnt and is just a way to shit on Roman for no reason

so

Drink"
"Yeah, thats fair enough, If asked that way it could be interpreted too many different ways."
"Pushing other nations to cause trouble is a threat to world peace, yeah? 

What you're suggesting is the biggest threat to world peace is the puppet not the puppet master, which is wrong. The threat comes from the nation orchestrating the conflict, not the nations actually at fighting. The nation providing guns/ammo/supplies/money are fuelling the conflict and causes the threat to peace. 

I understand what you're getting at, but its not strictly true when Russia and America have the ability to destabilise stable nations to instigate a conflict, not just take advantage of already failed states.These nations can create the puppets, not only using already existing ones.


On top of that, both America and Russia have directly invaded other nations in the last 15 years, not on UN peacekeeping missions, but actually illegally invading nations. "
"I mean, I dont know about the other stuff, but it is a well known fact that thousands were kicked of the roll before the election. Just wikipedia it, it was shown that the system contained numerous errors which discriminated against African-American voters. Leading to the U.S. commission on Civil Rights saying just that in 2001.

I'm not going to say that this caused Bush to win or whatever, but its dishonest to claim that the election was ""fair and square"" when this aspect of it has be documented to not be. "
"Yeah, people are all saying Cena was meant to get the belt back....but he was also meant to face Taker at maina, so which is it? You can't really have both unless Cena was going to drop the belt at fastlane, and if he was, why would he have won it back? 

I dont think Cena was ever meant to win the belt off Del Rio based on what the Maina card was meant to be."
"Thats just how they historically book the MitB winner though. They beat the holder again and again because they feel like the surprise of winning the world title negates the loses.

Every MitB winner goes on a losing streak before winning the title. "
"Yeah, he was injured so he was a RAW NXT and Superstars commentator in 2010-2011. Its where he began to really get over with the crowd because he was pretty funny and good at the role."
"And even the Rumble wasnt really his fault. That thing was booked to be a piece of shit, kofi didnt really have a cool spot, kane breaks the record for career elimination's in the most retarded way possible , Regins is booked to be in the conner for half the match and the roster is so thin only 4 guys had a believable chance of winning it. All the side stories and all the drama around a hero in the rumble wasnt there. It wasnt just that Regins won, it was also the fact that the rumble was missing everything that even a predictable rumble has. 

"
"ADR got to the final 4 in both WWEWHC tournaments, same with KO. The US and IC titles are being booked as upper-midcard titles, instead of a shitty comedy/nothing title like before. "
"I think the argument is, is that the Rumble is clearly a way to get the title off of Roman while protecting him. 

They want Roman chasing the title going into Maina, for people complaining Regins is 100% winning, it just wouldnt make sense.

I will admit though, if Lesnar's in the Rumble, he's probably winning, but he might not. He might be eliminated by someone and then feud with them going into maina instead.

Seriously, this Rumble has a lot more realistic possibilities than people are giving it credit for."
"Ziggler is dead in the middcard now. He's got an old gimmick and people just see him as being this king of the midcard guy. It really sucks, but it would take a lot to change this view of him"
"Honestly thats a positive for TNA. When they debuted on Mondays they hot shot a lot of shit and way to much was happening and they turned a lot of people off the product. I know nothing happening sucks, but it seems they learnt their lessons from 2010 and 2011, which is a positive."
"This is actually the best way to do this. Roman eliminates Big show is seconds like no one ever has before.Makes him come across as a beast. Then come the LoN guys come out and gang up and gang up on him till he's thrown out. Builds a sense of sympathy as he was unfairly treated and he should be the rightful champion. "
"This storyline makes sense and would work, the only thing is WWE really seems to be building to a HHH Vs Roman match, so I dont know where this match fits into this story."
"There will be an invasion coming with these new signings, my bet is that it will be framed as an NXT invasion, led by Balor, not an indie one."
"The build to payback was quite good too, but yeah as a whole, the PPV builds last year were terrible and the maina build was the worst"
"I didnt say it was difficult for people to see him, I was commenting on how there is a lack of will for non-US people to want to see him since he comments a lot on American culture and American politics and American news.

I am also from Australia and have been to many of those countries you mentioned. People who are really into politics and satire tend to be the ones who know who he is. Talk to anyone over the age of 35 and ask who he is. Or someone who doesnt like politics or satire. He is not nearly as well known outside of the US as he is in the US. "
"Not really. His comedy comes from satire of the American political process and American news cycle. Its....difficult for those who dont see these things on a regular basis to connect with it. Hence he isnt that well known outside of America apart from maybe small groups really into politics or satire. 

Its the same with Colbert."
"TTTT isnt cannon. Rusev tapping will never be brought up again."
"The praise for his promo skills do not equal his actual promo skills, he always seems to be stumbling over words. Still a good promo and great in ring, its just not what people on this sub claim it is."
"His talking always just comes across as so awkward. He is physically charismatic but by god does in not translate well in the scripted promo environment of WWE.  "
"yeah, this is the thing people sometimes forget. Titus is 38, quite old for an undercard wrestler. "
"Seriously, who's in the league? 

Barret who has one one match since April

Del Rio, a guy who has no heat

Rusev, who's been lost in the shuffle since April, going into weird feuds with Ziggler

And Sheamus who doesnt draw much heat.

It is a stable of mid-card heels that werent doing anything.

Owens has stuff going on for him and in kayfabe is typically booked as being better than them. Why would anyone want OWens in this stable?"
"They have a show where they can write who the winners are, and they still give half the awards to people who arent there. "
"Dude, they fucking sell the komora lock. Thats not meant to hurt for a long time, its meant to break your arm in a second so you tap before that happens. AND TAKER SOLD IT FOR MINUTES.

edit: Kimura, I cant spell"
"Seriously the closet that move has ever got to being kicked out off was HHH didnt do a stretcher job for it once. Thats it, I think every other time it has been a stretcher job."
"This is the main thing, his performance as the voice of gollum is really impressive in itself."
"Ambrose was meant to feud with Orton before Orton was injured. Still he has been butchered multiple times now."
"By that logic why is Britain red? No actual fighting took place on British soil"
"It really is, in other parts of reddit you could say a dissenting opinion and stay at 1, if you so much as say personally I dont get """". Bang downvotes to hell, for a different perspective. Its really terrible. "
"I would argue that the villian and many other characters where different, while the plot was the same, which to me, still made it engaging. 

I honestly think it was intended as almost a remake/reboot of the original star wars and that thats not inherently a bad thing."
"Australian territory grew during the war as they took control of New Guinea from Germany. But dont let these facts blind you."
"You broke the circlejerk, so downvotes to you.

Seriously I think Rollins carried RAW for pretty much the whole year, but its kinda sad that if you disagree with the circlejerk of this sub you just get downvoted to hell. "
"You realise that thousands and thousands of Australians died during the war, dramatically affecting the countries population right? 

Like, no fighting took place on Australian soil, but 500,000 fought in the war from a country of 5mil, i,e 10% of the entire country went to europe to fight. 

Compare that to the US witch had 4% of their population fight

Seriously just because there wasnt fighting on home soil does not mean the war did not affect them. "
"Eat

Sleep

Small Balls joke

Repeat

Now thats a gimmick I can get behind"
"The Cesaro circlejerk is so strong it really makes any conversation about him toxic."
"Thats fine. People werent saying that though. Most people were saying the crowd sucked because they were trying to get themselves over, and people were defending against that. 

If you dont like the european chanting thats fine, no ones defending against that."
"Fair enough if it took you out of the matches, I think people were defending the crowd against claims it was trying to get itself over, as it wasnt, just a normal english crowd at a sporting event.

If you didnt like that then thats fine, but dont blame the crowd, blame european sporting culture."
"You are 100% right. Some people who dont experience this perceive it as the crowd trying to get over, not a culture thing. So when people bitch about an English crowd singing at a sporting event, its the equivalent of bitching about a wrestling crowd bringing in signs. Its just part of the culture."
"sure, so is santino, but they've never really been taken seriously. "
"Thats an interesting one I hadnt thought of. 

I would argue the difference is Taker, while over the top, is meant to be a serious character, while stardust is meant more for comedy and its more of a comedy wrestlers can never be taken seriously, while they can still be over. 

But you're right, over the top gimmicks can work."
"I think you've missed the point, its a culture thing. There is a culture in england of chanting anything and everything at all sporting events. I think people are trying to explain this culture difference to not just americans but other nationalities on this sub claiming that the ""crowd was getting themselves over"" explaining that in England, no matter what sporting event it is, the crowd will always chant like that anyway. 

Its not a ""stupid american doesnt understand our chants"" its more of a ""we actually chant all the time at all sporting events, we werent trying to get ourselves over, its just the culture"" sorta thing."
"""Sandow was so over"", yeah, because of his chemistry with the Miz. It wasnt just him, it was the entire act that was over."
"I cant tell if thats sarcasm or not, but the pervious 2 most over guys, D-Bry and Punk, were not over the top gimmicks and just toned up versions of them selves, same even with SCSA. Like can you name someone with a really over the top gimmick that was over and taken seriously in pro-wrestling? Genuine question. "
"I mean, based on previous career Jericho should also be A+, but recently in the past 3 years he's jobbed to young guys. Sting is the same, in that sure at one stage, he was at that level, but his current booking doesnt reflect that."
"In all fairness Cena, on a good day, does that too, just with ""Lets go Cena/Cena sucks"" chants instead."
"Historically the December PPV never does well in buyrates, even for a B show. To try and combat this WWE often put big matches on the PPV to increase buyrates to a normal level. 

This leads to a strange thing, where big matches take place on the December PPV, but not a lot of people watch. Leading to the idea that TLC is a throw away PPV."
"I honestly think their current mentality is that Del Rio is just floating till Cena comes back, so he can be beat, because feuding with Cena will elevate him anyway.

Its really strange. Like, it seems Rusev is the #2 guy in the LoN while Del Rio is just above the resident jobber Barret. You would think it'd be the other way around. Thats not even mentioning this fucking MexAmerica/Seb/Swagger triangle thing."
"Summerslam, that was a great card with really good matches and good build. "
"Not even Sheamus really. He's in a heel stable full of midcarders in order to compete with Roman on the main event level. WWE has 0 stars right now."
"The TNA world title is no longer recognised as a world title, it is an Indy with syndication at this point."
"England doesnt have its own parliament like the other parts of the UK and are beholden to the British parliament, made up of members from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. 

edit: I am the dumb"
"While I agree, its important to note that there are other metrics than just crowd reaction to see who is over. For example if the ratings spike when a person is on or advertised to be, that is also a sign that they are over, (Cena for example has shown to spikes ratings, even if the crowd isnt always too hot on him) "
"Punk left, D-bry and Orton got injured, same with Show, Rey I think killed a guy and also left, Christian ""retired"", Cena went on holiday and Mark Henry became the worlds greatest Jobber.


HHH and Steph went on to decide they werent actually heels, but only playing them and Kane got fat.

Its shocking how only Miz, Del Rio and Kane are the only full timers still in WWE from this video. And if this was 2 months ago, Del Rio wouldnt even be there.

Seriously when you watch previous clips of WWE you really realise how much Punk and then D-Bry held the entire show together, even if they werent in the main-event, it gave fans someone to root for. Now we have no one, with all the favs in 50/50 club and only Regins being pushed."
"I think the comparison to make is Ryback. ""Feed me more"" is over and people chant it, but as soon as Ryback is in the match, people stop caring and his matches lose heat until the finish when Ryback starts the Feed me more chant. 

With Bryan it is very clear that during his entire match, the crowd cares. They care what happens, they care if he whens and they are invested in him. 

Just watch a D-Bry match and its very clear he is over, not just his chant."
"Abbot preforms poorly in debates, so he refused to have them in 2010 and 2013. 

Seriously, thats it. Abbot was invited to have a debate on Q and A numerous times and refused."
"Or what colour was,

Seriously that movie is shot in sepia tone"
"It takes 4 heels to be EVEN with Regins. He's the best but is fucked because he turned down the authorities offer. Its actually an alright storyline and character, this sub seems to get off on claiming he doesnt have a character. But honestly his current storyline with being screwed with even though he deserves the belt is the most interesting he's been since SS14."
"There were decent because they didnt look like wrestling shirts, they just looked like normal cool looking shirts."
"Hey now, HHH feud with Nash over who sent who a text was not a long pointless feud.......it was a short pointless feud."
"The idea is that WWE needs to be building stars up to be able to face Brock. Its on WWE for failing to do that. Brock is booked as the final boss a hero must overcome, WWE just hasnt got a hero to the stage were they can do that yet, and the one hero they did (Regins) fans shit on."
"Yeah, I think this is the thing.


People believe that change is a bad thing, it has negative connotations around it. But sometimes it isnt. RT has changed quite a bit from this time last year, yet it seems to have been for the better."
"Cena, HHH, Taker, Regins, Rock, other Regins. Seriously there is probably about 4 guys who would be higher choices for Brock, the problem is he's faced them all by now multiple times."
"Ambrose back at MiTB. They've actually killed his momentum a few times this year to transfer it to Regins. Even on last nights RAW, they didnt pin an uso, they pinned ambrose. 

You could also argue Rusev to some extent, Del Rio too. 

They cooled Owens off before giving him the IC.

It happens so regularly that you tend not to notice it, but its very clear WWE doesnt want anyone else over. I mean look at the league of nations. Instead of making Sheamus a main-event heel, who could hang with the main event level face, they took 7 middcards. It implies that Sheamus is shit and all the other guys are shit and cant hang with Roman, but their numbers allow them to compensate for this.

WWE is just not interested in making anyone the main event other than a select few."
"You didn't mention him with Big show 

/s

Seriously, when he has someone to play off he is great, even his stuff with rookie D-bry was good."
"Yeah.

Like Owens was meant to be a heel upper-midcarder/main-event possible sorta guy.

The tag teams were meant to bolster the tag division and appeal to kids really.

Breeze was brought up to be a midcarder like Ziggler.

The only one I'd say hasnt been as sucessful is maybe Neville. But again WWE was lacking a flippyshit guy and he fits the bill. Theres always at least one designated flippy guy on the card. 

So all in all the guys have all fit their roles well."
"Thats mainly because people seem to have a problem differentiating between the the sentences ""what they should do"" and ""what they are doing"""
"I think TNA burned a lot of people. Like lots of people have tried TNA over the years, look at how there ratings fluctuated to see that. But every time people tried it, they got burned as half-way through a really compelling story they through in the typical TNA bullshit.

A good TNA is good for all fans, but I think a lot of people have given up ever thinking TNA will be good. Hence the LOLTNA is failing stuff. "
"Its really telling too. They had a fucking world title match in that third hour and still lost 200K.

Raw is a 3 hour show, marketed towards kids. And guess what? Kids dont stay up to 11, they go to bed at 10 at latest, id say 9-10 is a common bed time. Its no wonder they lose viewers in droves after 10."
"I personally find it very hard to imagine Breeze main-eventing maina with his current gimmick. And if we are talking about all gimmicks can be taken seriously if booked right, I also would argue that Fandango, or stardust, or Xavier woods current gimmicks, would also never main-event maina in there current form. Why? Because they are comedy or wacky gimmicks. Im not saying that the guys in these gimmicks couldnt main event. They all could, they all have the talent for it. Im just saying I personally think that some gimmicks, no matter how well they are booked, are  not main-event level gimmicks and that I think Breeze's is one of them."
"Wrestling is a little weird. While this is true, more viewers = more adverts. Wrestling has a lot of trouble finding advertisers full stop. It doesn't matter how high or low the ratings are, the group of advertisers willing to advertise on a wrestling show doesnt grow or shrink by much.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that advert money on a wrestling show does not hinge on ratings as much as most other shows."
"Realistically? 

Ratings will rise substantially as they always do in Maina season, when football ends. Coupled with a Cena return, Lesnar and Rock coming back and creative starting to care again, of course ratings are going to rise.

The real thing is by how much? And on top of that, this time next year will be the most telling. Just how much are ratings going to fall again? Because on this current path, when no full time roster wrestler is anything close to over, I can see it dropping to below 2."
"D- bry was the last main character that fans cared about. Since then the show has either revolved around Cena, Rollins or Regins. A 10 year stale act, a sneaky heel and a half-over mixed reactions face.

Honestly, people talk about what WWE is missing, I think its simple. They lack a main character that fans are attached too."
"That sounds amazing.

Only problem is isnt Orton out till at least after mania? "
"But Breeze wasnt a main eventer in NXT? He wasnt really in the title hunt. 

I think people are just saying they find it hard to see his gimmick in the main event scene, thats all. Not that he could be a main-eventer in the future, just not with his current gimmick. Its the same with fandango. "
"Yeah, totally, they are jokes but..

My other point was that Rollins got injured. These guys werent meant to be main eventers, they were being booked as mid-cards. When Rollins got injured they needed a main-event heel. This faction of mid-cards, while weak apart, can be booked stronger together. Like no joke, this is very similar to the Nexus storyline. 

Thats what makes me so worried because we know how that ended."
"Its a little unfair to judge them based on 1 RAW. WWE has had to change a lot cause Rollins got injured so this whole league of nations stable is something they just put together, give it time. 

In saying that, I'm so cynical about WWE booking at the moment that I fully expect that in 2 months the League will be a joke."
"The Miz's heel run during 2010-2011 is the same, Edge in 08-10 too. These guys got heat by using creativity in being despicable and/or also being irritating to the extent that people wanted to see get hit.

I dont understand this subs obsession with PG meaning you cant get heat or cheered. Like I can name a dozen great heels who where heels in the PG era and got legit heat, as well as a half dozen faces who did too. 

The current problem is that the guys who got heat were vets from the era of Kayfabe, which seems to really help their heel mentality. These new guys never experienced that, so its harder for them."
"I do understand what you're saying. But I think you're forgetting why the Nexus was created in the first place. RAW had no main event level heels for Cena to go against, so WWE created the Nexus as a main-event heel creating machine for Cena to go against. Thats what it was the whole time, just something for Cena to do, till another main-event level heel could be built up. Nexus were never meant to be anything more than filler until a proper main event heel was created. Barret could of been that heel, but it didnt pan out. 

I understand wanting more from the Nexus, but its important to realise the Nexus wasn't created for that."
"Oh god, there's a heel stable of 7 guys including Barret and the tag team champs, going against a superman type character and his buddies. This is the fucking Nexus storyline all over again isnt it."
"The best thing about Cody is that his gimmick's have been so vastly different that though he's been around forever people haven't put him in a box yet. Like Ziggler has been put in the midcard box, Miz is in that comedy box, and people have a hard time seeing them as anything out of these roles. But Cody? With a different gimmick he could be where-ever, there isnt many guys like that left on the roster honestly. "
"Its important to protect the titles prestige over all else, hence it being in the main event mainly. This mentality, of course, gets thrown out the window every couple of months because WWE is run by 5 monkeys and an eccentric billionaire ."
"The last good Rumble was like 2010 when everyone thought HBK was winning to face taker at WM26 for the championship and instead Edge returned and won. 

Since then the rumble winners have been Sheamus and Del Rio (to next to no heat), Cena (for twice in a lifetime), Bootista and Regins. Not that the winner makes the rumble good, but it impacts it and it really sucks how the rumble is presented as being anyones shot and in reality it isnt."
"I claim the month of Fastlane.....Thats when the posting of this get super intense."
"They did it for buys. Rock draws, its why WM 28 has the largest buy-rate of a WWE PPV. And historically, WM triple threat main-events dont do...great. 

I honestly think this is a time it could have though. The story going into it with Rock fighting for legacy, Cena fighting for redemption and Punk fighting for revenge could have been one hell of a story.

But no, Twice in a lifetime.......yay.. "
"Fair enough, he jobs a lot now, but I think this has made people forget that Jericho didnt really job much at all up until his 2012 comeback. Jericho jobbing to Cena in what 04, 05? Was a much bigger deal than current Jericho jobbing to Fandango.

Jericho is interesting, because beating him has lost its meaning, but he is kinda doing what most people believe is a good thing, putting over younger guys. "
"Second-last eliminated in the royal rumble? Thats impressive, he's up there with the likes of Big-show and Santino. 

Seriously, I dont disagree, he mostly had stuff to do and was pushed reasonably well to great honestly, but he wasnt getting the Regins push, which is what I think people are trying to get at."
"A selfless vet putting over the young up and comer, what a scumbag /s "
"The reason why it didnt happen is because Rock Vs Cena was already on the Card for maina 28, when Punk was white hot. Then twice in a lifetime was booked for maina 29."
"He talks about it on the DVD Best in the world. He says that when he did the pipe bomb and the entire lead up to MiTB he was actually gone. He signed a 2 day extension into MiTB because they put him in the main event. That new contract was signed half way through MiTB, after Vince explained to him the plan for the coming months (which at the time did not include Nash)  "
"Theres no guarantee that an Indy promotion would sign him to a solid living type of deal, though I would guess it would be highly likely they would.

But then again, guys that were buried in the WWE like Paul London, have had worse indy runs then when they first left. Though again I cant see that happening to Cesaro.

I do agree with you on it, he could if he was frustrated by WWE and be fine.
I totally understand your point now, thanks for clarifying."
"The young bucks were offered NXT with NXT money, not main roster, like Cesaro. Thats why they didnt sign. Its like $25,000 a year if you're in NXT, and theres no guarantee of a main roster push. On top of that, if they are turned into jobbers it could damage an indy return. 

Cesaro is in a much different situation as he is in the main roster, on the main show. 

People in WWE main roster earn substantially more money than people on the indies on average, if you dont believe that I want whatever drugs youre on. Thats what makes it cushy, the pile of money you get for doing it. Shit road schedule and being worked to death, but theres a lot more money in it. 

If you still dont believe me that guys earn more in WWE, its why D-bry left the indies and he was a massive indy star at the time. He left for the money and once he was out of NXT, he started earning big bucks."
"I smell a Rumble return, followed immediately by Big Show eliminating him."
"The Doom and gloom posts on this sub are just stupid, Brock and Cena are both back next month, the Rock will be back too, even if he doesnt wrestle. Like the WWE is shit at the moment, but its always shit between HiAC and RR anyway. The WWE will be fine.
"
"Yeah, apparently he's got a lot of wit, and if given long form promos he is apparently said to be really really good. "
"You leave Kofi's legendary 3rd IC reign alone /s 

Seriously, Luke Harper has something about him thats different. I dont know if he'd ever be pushed to the main event, but there is something about him that makes him stand out."
"Is there any update on how long Cesaro's out? Because that sounds like a great match"
"Guys come up with their own character, WWE has some input, but its for the wrestlers to work out. New Day is a good example, they got together and wanted a gimmick yeah? They worked on it and worked on it and Vince gave them the base, they twigged the idea and got over from it yeah? Its a shit system, but its the way it works, and Sandow didnt come up with a character Vince liked."
"Whats that? More Big Bang theory and Harry Potter movies? You got it"
"Wrestlers pick their own gimmick that the WWE sign off on, Its on Sandow for not coming up with new gimmick after Mizdow. I know that sounds harsh but its way things work."
"Sandow was without a gimmick after mizdow. When he did get a gimmick he was on RAW pretty regularly. Then the hogan thing happened and he was without a gimmick again."
"Thats because they're a nostalgia act. They're there to do nostalgia spots and put over young guys, thats what they were hired to do. Now the nostalgia has worn off they may shake things up a bit with the Dudleys though, well, hopefully. "
"He needs to win the US championship to complete the triple crown of forfeiting the title after mania."
"I think its the fact the champ got beat on the C show, that has people a little annoyed. Imagine if Rollins got beat on Superstars? It would be stupid and he was beat on every RAW for like 2 months."
"This is all your opinion, which is perfectly fine.

From a fact based, purely non-opinionated stand point, buy rates and ratings go up when Cena is on the show and Cena has been the biggest merch seller for a decade apart from a few weeks here and there when Punk was hot.

The causes can be debated about why this is the case, but it is clear that Cena is a massive draw either way. 

Now personally I think that the biggest problem with WWE is that, with the exception of Regins (who is over with kids and women), no one new in the WWE is over enough to be in the main-event scene and WWE seem determined to make sure no one gets over to a certain extent, by instead pushing the brand of WWE above its current roster."
"Yeah I was confused by that too.

When you look at the ending of last RAW when Roman beat the shit out of everyone with a chair, the crowd was really into it too. Last nights show was long and boring, but man one thing that stood out was that Roman was cheered when he got those chair shots in."
"Its amazing how one line from Cole can make me hate an entire gimmick. "
"UNCHR was set up because of this. Jew's tried to flee and no country would accept them. The US took some in, but they also turned some away, like most countries did. The UNCHR was meant to make it illegal to turn away refugees like that. No one's claiming the US is worse than any other country or better, just that they turned back refugees during the war, which they did, like many many other countries."
"Yeah I absolutely agree. Thats why this sub can be so infuriating sometimes. Theres nearly 100,000 people on it so it has lots of different views.

But if you dont' want to have a giant midcard, you need squash matches. If you want the giant midcard thats fine, just dont complain about it.

I think you maybe right about the guys being higher on the card, but as I said there's 100,000 people on the sub, someone's fav is going to be Henry, and when they see him in the job squad they're going to be annoyed."
"I suppose thats my argument. Roman being an underdog clearly isnt working. Make him a bad-ass samoan who squashes guys every now and again."
"Its still strange to see Barrett where he is now and think, this guy is a 5 time IC champ."
"Its very clear that Owens is going to be at least the #3 to #1 heel in the company. I know a lot of people feel like he's being wasted currently, and there appears to be some truth to that. But Owens is and has been well protected booking wise since going to the main roster."
"RAW needs more short squash matches to give some guys momentum. Like why wasn't Roman Vs Big show a 3 min squash to give Roman momentum in the tournament? Seriously, more squash matches would really help build guys at the expense of guys who are already regarded as jobbers."
"Ha, remember when they did THE title unification match in a B PPV in December? With 2 guys no one wanted to see wrestle again?

ahhh

Good times. "
"They had a set direction. Brock beat Taker at Maina, became the biggest monster heel in the company, win the title in a squash match. Have Regins, with his momentum from survivor series, win the Rumble and go over the monster heel at maina to cement himself as the new face of the company. Fans shit on it. Its not like that shit wasnt planned out. It was planned out for 2 years, but the fans werent having a bar of it they wanted a last minute change to Bryan. 

Like I get where you are coming from. Their week to week seems so incoherent sometimes, but they do have overall plans, just plans the fans didnt like."
"Yeah, but the other main event was Punk Vs Hardy on like 3 of those PPV's and were in the main-event of some of them.....Like there was other watchable content......who have we got? Regins/Sheamus and a bunch of midcarders going no where. "
"In all fairness its WWE's fault that he's in a shitty gimmick that the fans dont overly care about.

His performance though is all him."
"His current gimmick seems to be to confuse the fans about his current gimmick until they stop caring about it."
"And its not like one half of the uso's or the one half of the luca dragons needed to be protected. Even Ryback wouldnt of been overly hurt by losing. Sheamus could of used the momentum to showcase his dominance. Imagine the show opening tomorrow with Sheamus coming out and talking about how he won a 3Vs1 match and then went on to be the WWEWHC in the same night?

But no, got to protect the an uso, its more important. "
"I thought the idea of having them as a 2 man tag team would help protect the other Wyatts when they lost. But no, Rowan is taken out like a joke and the monster they've been building for months was taken out like he was nothing special. Then the Wyatts lost. If thats the way it was going to go down, why not just make it a 4Vs2 elimination match? God why wouldnt they protect arguably the current #1 or #2 heel? "
"There was a nasty botch in 25, that Meltz thought that someone had gotten legitimately hurt in, so he brought it down by 0.25. Also I would claim the build for 25 wasnt that great. HBK was the anti-taker wanting to end the streak and Taker was trying to keep it. I thought 26 story of HBK's obsession with the loss was much better.

I think its pretty much accepted that 26 match wasnt as good as 25."
"Alveraz had the idea that WWE should have Bayley take over all the charity and PR stuff that Cena does, while Regins should not be the face of any of that and just be a quite badass at the top of the card.


I thought it was a cool idea."
"I would honestly be ok with this. Imagine Brock enters in at #1 and wrecks shop the entire rumble. Throwing people left right and centre, just beating the shit out of everyone. Suplexing guys out of the ring, having all the guys jump on top of him at once and him giving no fucks and powering out. It would be a pretty cool thing to see.

I mean, I'm not to keen on the idea of Regins/Lesnar II though."
"The NFL is not watched much at all in Australia or Europe from my experience. But WWE is, while not big, at least seen by more people than the NFL in these places.

The NFL may still have more viewers due to such a high viewership in the US than the moderate WWE globally viewership though."
"Not to mention the fact that, The Rock, Mark Henry, Booker T and Del Rio have all been world champs in the WWE. Im not saying the dude isnt racist, theres plenty of stories about him being racist in very strange ways. But its not like he's never pushed a person of colour before."
"Interesting that Punk came out second, after the champ. It does kinda show that Punk was regarded as the bigger star than Del Rio at the time."
"They want a new guy to be on top for the next decade, just like Cena has been. Not a veteran who might only be able to be on top for 3-5 years because his body is already shot from wrestling for the past decade. At the end of the day thats what this comes down to."
"Didnt Cena Vs Bryan and no one turned heel and they were both full time? "
"Yeah. The thing with Owens is, I actually believe him to be in a great spot, he's positioned as the #2 or #3 heel in the company right? But the thing is when you hear people in the business talk about him they all say he actually should be the #1 heel, which is interesting and says a lot about Owens. "
"Taker was on Smackdown, Cena on RAW most of the time. When both Cena and Taker were on Smackdown, Cena wasn't on Takers level. When the brand split ended, Taker was only doing the Maina matches, of which it made no sense for him to Vs Cena."
"Currently? Yeah. I think if Jericho was actually given the opportunity to be, he would be slightly better, but he seems content to put over younger talent and he only works house shows so I'm not sure if he counts.

But I was commenting more on how a lot of pervious wrestlers and those with-in the wrestling business all hold Owens in high regard. Some on this sub hold, like Bo Dallas in high regard, so its not always the best judge. It just shows how underutilised Owens currently is, hopefully that changes Sunday, but I dont have high hopes for that."
"Meltzer has the same thoughts, its interesting how highly regarded Owens is by people in and close to the wrestling business. "
"Y2J was not different, it was an accident he hit her, but it was meant to look like he hit her, the story was around him hitting her.

Y2J got his fucking ass handed to him in a unsanctioned match and then walked out of the PPV the WHC, and then beat HBK in the blow off. 

No one expect Y2J to beat HBK after hitting his wife, but he fucking did. I can't comment on the Batista one, because I wasnt watching at the time."
"I have been downvoted quite often in this sub for saying Cesaro doesnt have the mic skills to be a top guy. 

There's a group of people on this sub who want Cesaro pushed really really badly and get really annoyed if you say anything at all against him"
"I should of been clearer. Cena could and did rap on the fly on the tour bus in europe, the story is he went 8mins on the fly and thats how he ended up with the rap gimmick. 

I was just commenting on how Cena is quite good of thinking on the fly, while Roman isnt, or isnt good at showing that yet."
"Im not a historian, it's not what I assume.

Historical consensus is that a preacher named Jesus lived around this time. As I am not a historian, I tend to believe that the numerous scholars who are and who study this time period are correct. If you dont want to because you dont believe theres enough evidence then fine, but the general historical consensus is that Jesus existed.

Interestingly enough, there is not a consensus on whether Moses existed or whether the Jews where in fact slaves at all or a lot of other stuff in the Bible. But they have found evidence of a man named Jesus."
"Yeah, by giving him promo time to hone his talent, it doesnt happen overnight. The dude still had a lot of wit to begin with though. Making up raps on the fly aint too easy."
"No, Roman sources. Historians dont claim a man named Jesus did this or that, but the historical consensus is that a preacher named Jesus was quite active and well known at this time. 

Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus 

and if wikipedia isnt enough for you, just check out the sources down the bottom. I became really interested in this a while back. Im under the impression that John the baptist is actually more documented than Jesus is, but I could be wrong."
"There are historical accounts of both Jesus and john the baptist in non-religious historical texts.

Just look on the wikipedia page, and if thats not enough, look at the sources beneath."
"You can't build a story around it with the rest of the roster in a WHC singles tournament. Like I prefer a 2 on 2 match over a 5 Vs 5 containing 4 random people just thrown into it at the last minute. "
"I think Taker worked a lot of big ""monster"" types who couldnt really do much throughout his entire career. Cena, while he has carried some guys to matches, isnt as skilled at carrying a ""monster"" to a good match as Taker is."
"It's 100% Reasonable to assume that the WWE would of talked to Flair about it before talking about his dead son. It isnt people giving WWE credit, thinking its some beacon of honesty, its people assuming that WWE is normal. The fact that they didnt get his permission or even tell him is quite vile and despicable."
"Cena has twice the wit Roman has, its less noticeable because Cena seems to go off script and be entertaining. Roman just Recaps without that wit. "
"I honestly dont know about the Flair family, none of us do. And you're clearly very against the line being said. 

But this idea had to of come from somewhere right? Most of WWE creative dont know an awful lot about wrestling (seriously they're from like c-list tv shows), so I cant see the writers bringing it up. That means that either paige, charlotte or vince thought of the idea, and charlotte at the very least agreed to the line being said about her own brother. This means that Charlotte is either a horrible person who did something to tarnish her brothers memory, or she taught her brother wouldn't of minded the idea. I get that its a horrid line, but when discussing about weather Reid would of been ok with it being said about him, I think Charlottes judgement should come into account. It shouldnt form the whole idea by any means, but she knew her brother. "
"If Ambrose turned heel he would also be the #1 heel in the company and would likely be in the title match at maina, as well as the freedom of being a heel.

Im not sure casual fans would boo him though. Smarks love him and kids really seem to like him too, though they might turn on him if he turned on Regins. 

I think at best he would be getting a 50/50 reaction in mark cities and nearly 100% cheers in smark cities. Not really the ideal situation, especially when WWE really need to get Roman over as a mega baby face. I could be wrong, but personally I think WWE wont turn him heel. "
"Jesus Christ dude, I hate mentioning anything about Cesaro in this sub for this reason, I was just saying that he's moved up the card from when he was Vs los matadors, a face New day and luca dragons. The fact that he is wrestling main-eventers and upper-midcarders now means in Kayfabe, he has moved up the card. It doesnt matter that he lost, he's still shown to have competitive matches, he's still presented as more of threat than before summerslam. I'm not making a judgement saying if thats good or bad, just that since summerslam he has risen from lower-midcard to mid-upper-midcard. Thats all."
"I think its more of a descriptor of a certain type of cartoon. Like it describes cartoons that are influenced?(for lack of a better word) by Japanese culture. Or at least thats the way most people seem to use it.

So its more like saying this wine is bitter Vs this wine is sweet. Either way its still wine, just of different flavours."
"They've only got 5 hours though /s 

Seriously, I remember Dashing Cody Rhodes who was a midcarder only on Smackdown 5 years ago getting more story and attention then any current midcarder, and he wasnt the only one. Most actual middcarders had story's and there was only 2 hours of television. "
"I hope its not Dean because a heel Dean going against a Face Roman would be terrible. Who the fuck is going to boo Dean over Regins? 


How would Dean ever get any heat, or Roman get any cheers? How would the storylines even work? How do you script a mess like that? 


Honestly I think no one turns, Regins wins, aftermatch handshake, out comes barret and Shemus. Cash-in, Roman Vs Shamus feud until RR.  "
"I would argue because he has opportunities to wrestle guys like Regins and Big show and be in those main-event tag matches so much would make him a solid midcarder. 

I was just commenting how earlier this year he was on the tag scene not wrestling these mainevent/midcard guys and instead going against the undercard tag teams, thats all. And that losing to Big Show is higher on the card than beating los matadors as crazy as that sounds.  "
"18C wasn't changed because members of his own party threatened to cross the floor to vote against it, as well as the senate refusing to pass it."
"In all fairness he's actually a lot higher on the card now than he was pre summerslam. People loved his teaming with Kidd but he was not booked nearly as strong then. Now he's in the upper-midcard only really losing to main-eventers. Not commenting whether he deserves to be there or not, just commenting on his placement this year."
"In all fairness Ambrose and Owens was going to be a match at suriviour series before Rollins got injured. Like this isnt what WWE planned, their champ did get injured."
"No you can't 

Ziggler and Ambrose and Ryback to some extent get larger reactions and are booked much stronger than Cesaro. 

The 5 Vs 5 on Raw a few weeks ago showed the guys in the main event. Regins, Ambrose, Rollins, New day, Ryback, and the returning uso's. 

Or the fatal 4 way? Regins, Ziggler, Del-Rio, Owens. These are the top tier guys, notice how Cesaro wasnt in any of these important main event matches?

You list all the people the Ryback, Ziggler and Ambrose lost to but you havent acknowledged that Cesaro has lost to the Big show, Owens and has not been booked strong at all, losing in all these tournaments to make others look strong.


On top of that trying to claim that Ambrose is not #2 is just strange. Its been the Regins and Ambrose show for months now for fuck sack. He was left of HiAC because Orton got injured and he got the biggest pop by just appearing on screen.

I get it, people want more for Cesaro, thats fine, but dont twist the truth."
"America doesn't really have full universal healthcare, and all other western nations that do (read every western nation), actually pay less on health than America based on GDP.


So what your seeing as universal healthcare is vastly different than what every other western nation sees as universal healthcare. On top of this smokers actually cost LESS to healthcare systems than non-smokers because they die sooner. Same with obesity. So claiming that they should have to pay more isnt actually helping the healthcare system.
"
"The problem is that people want Regins to be a heel too much, so much that he will be cheered by turning heel, the opposite of what a heel should have. 

How will he ever get heat when people are cheering because he did what they always wanted him to do? 

He would get the opposite reaction he gets now, cheers from smarks, boo's from marks, which is actually worse."
"I vaguely remember reading that house elves could do anything asked of them, they were that powerful. "
"Thats a dangerous slope though. Smokers should pay for their healthcare becomes Obese people pay for healthcare, becomes price for healthcare is dependent on age and other factors etc. 


Then that wondrous universal healthcare starts becoming a lot less universal. I understand the sentiment though, but taxing the source can raise funds without raising issues in the healthcare system."
"Yeah, even Brock lost his first match to Cena for this reason."
"Thats simply not true. People didnt ""tune into RAW to see what happened to Rollins"", the first hour of RAW was actually average, theyre wasnt some influx of curious viewers, the rating didnt reflex that. The show opened average then fell of a cliff in the third hour. The 2 shows before, when Roman main-evented,they didnt tune out and the third hour held. Im not claiming he's some massive draw or anything, just that, statistics that the WWE has no control over, show that people stayed and watched to see Roman in the main-event. He is over and claiming otherwise is untrue. "
"The mexcian wave thing is not a good metric. Cena Vs Rollins, you know probably the 2 most over full time guys? There was a mexcian wave during one of their matches a couple of months ago.

On top of this the 2 weeks after HiAC where Roman main-evented RAW veiwership stayed above 3mil in the 3rd hour, while last week, when he didnt, it was down to 2.85mil. This isnt WWE making up views, its a real metric. Roman is over with causal fans and its really dishonest to claim otherwise. 
"
"I understand what you want now. It sounds like you want what Smackdown sorta had back in the day with the Smackdown 6, yeah? Where all these 6 guys were pushed as the main-eventers of the show"
"Ok thats a very valid concern and I see it on this sub often.


But my argument always comes down to, what if it was Bryan being pushed like that? Or Owens? Or some other internet darling?

I honestly think the majority of people wouldn't mind that and actually want that. So they use this excuse of ""he's boring"" or ""we dont want another Cena"" or ""its predictable booking"" to describe Regins because honestly they just want their favourites in that spot and are bitter that Regins has taken it. 

You see this in the way people simply discuss and fantasy book guys, they want another Cena, but they want that Cena to be their favourite wrestler and its crazy.

So I'll ask you, if you could have 5/6 guys being pushed as moderately over, or you could have Daniel Bryan being pushed as THE face of the WWE, which would you choose?"
"Owens beat Cena clean on debut and then feuded with him for 3 months with lots of build. Dont act like WWE wasnt behind Owens and he only got over because the fans chose him. Cesaro definitely, WWE is against him, but they have really been behind Owens since his debut and its dishonest to claim otherwise. "
"The wave was done in a Rollins Vs Cena match. Going to try and claim that either of those guys are not over also?"
"Is he over?

Well when he main-evented RAW, not last week, but the previous 2 weeks, viewership stayed above 3mil in the 3rd hour. In comparison, when he didnt main-event RAW last week, viewership was at 2.85mil.


I know its only one metric, but it shows that in some way, people are interested in him more than a lot of the roster. Sure WWE favour him, but isnt that why a lot of the IWC hate him?

If the WWE didnt favour him, I would argue he would be a lot more over with the IWC.

edit: downvoted because I used statistics? Veiwership indicates that Regins is one of the most over guys on the roster."
"I actually looked this up because it interested me.

The UK is the State that Northern Ireland belongs to, and its actually listed as a province of the UK by the ISO, while England, Scotland and Wales are classed as Countries. So saying its only a part of the UK and nothing else is false. 

I understand what you're trying to say by claiming its in ""legal limbo""  but the way its phrased makes it sound like you're claiming its like a break away state or something, not a complicated legal compromise. "
"I can not actually remember a time when Sheamus wasnt booked strong. He won the WWE, won KOTR, won a RR, won the WHC, won the US championship, got injured came back and won the MItB. When was he on a 7 month long losing streak?  "
"I actually hadnt considered it in that way. 

I feel like the gimmick he got over in wouldnt have been allowed in PG but I think he's a very charismatic guy, and his feud with Vince is what really helped getting him over. He has a family friendly podcast and sometimes he drifts into Stone cold mode or whatever on i and it still has an impact. So I think he would have gotten over, just in a different way."
"I dont remember giving any examples of how I thought clickbait titles work but ok "
"In all fairness the Ukraine thing actually has pretty much guaranteed that Ukraine can never be apart of NATO due to territorial disputes. "
"Honestly I'm being realistic, in what way will changing to TV14 help ratings? 

Kids wont be allowed to watch, women wont want to watch it, leaving only one demographic left, a demo which is already dominated by the UFC and other MMA. House show attendance would decrease as families stop attending and only the father goes to watch, and merch sales will drop as less kids watch the product. Toy companies will pull out and other advertisers will be harder to find because they dont want to limit their audience or be linked to a TV14 show.

So how will any of this increase ratings? Im being serious I want to know why people think it will increase ratings."
"I'm not saying they're not.
 
But WWE had a guy with serious mental issues caused by concussions kill his entire family. Other athletes in other sports also suffered similar problems, leading to most other sports changing practices in order to reduce concussions and blood also. Like WWE has actually kept up with other sports in this regard.

WWE wrestlers are also in far more matches than anyone in the UFC or boxing also which means they are far more likely to be damaged due to the sheer amount at which they preform."
"It worked because the storylines were really good and they had guys who oozed charisma like SCSA and Rock. Not because it was TV14."
"Oh ok, fair enough, I wasn't too sure about it honestly. I stand by my original point though, that RT has changed to being more about getting viewers than making the best possible content and that most people, wether rightfully or not, associate this with the Fullscreen deal. Again, Im not saying its good or bad, just that to me personally, It seems like that happened."
"I honestly think its to do with kids. Kids love him, so they'll beg to stay up to watch Regins in the 3rd hour, otherwise they'll be sent to bed."
"Yes, get rid of an either demographic who buy most of the merch, in the hopes of gaining people who arent repulsed by miscarriage story lines and an over use of blood. That'll raise ratings.

Seriously what do people think would happen if WWE went back to TV14? There wont be chair shots to the head. Abortion and miscarriage storylines would not fly with investors in this day and age and wanting wrestlers to bleed more often is damaging to their health and the health of the ref. So how would changing to TV14 actually improve ratings? Because all I can see it doing is reducing ratings as kids wont be watching it at all anymore, and the majority of people who like seeing ""hardcore"" stuff watch the UFC anyway."
"I understand your point, but they want Regins as champ. Who the fuck is going to boo Owens or a heel ambrose or any other main eventer over Regins? 

HHH and Sheamus are the only 2 people on the roster that will actually be booed more than Regins, and giving the belt to the blandness of Sheamus is not a good idea. Thus HHH is the only person I can see fans actually wanting to be champion less than Regins, so he would make a good heel in that regard."
"My memory may be a bit fuzzy on this, but weren't the know being clickbait before the Funhaus thing?"
"Oh yeah, the sponsorship stuff is great and I really like that they're doing that.

The click-bait titles, I would say, doesnt have much to do with Funhaus. Yes Funhaus were using them before, but it is infinitely more likely that the change to click-bait came from above i.e. Fullscreen rather than from beneath, i.e. funhaus. Only speculation of course though, it very well could of been neither. 

Im just explaining the mentality shift from focus on producing content for the love of it Vs producing it to make money. Im not saying one is better or anything like that, just that it appears to me personally, that RT shifted towards making more viral videos. Again, Im not saying thats a bad thing, just a thing that appeared to happen after the Fullscreen purchase."
"Maybe, maybe not, its hard to say, but its easy to blame full screen for it"
"There has been a large increase in content tailor made for advertisers and a massive push by the company to get views. Click-bait titles  those outros asking people to share and subscribe etc. I understand that views and advertising pay for the content, but more and more content has been designed make a product/products that generates the most amount of views, not make the best product possible. Its almost like quantity over quality. Again, I'm not saying that any of this is a bad thing, it helps RT have a larger budget to make more better shows. X-ray and Vav for example, I can almost guarantee does not make money because the production value for animation is through the roof and the videos sit at around 500k views. 

But I can understand why some fans are unhappy. They feel like the shows arent made for them anymore, but for viral-ness...if that makes sense."
"I understand why they did it and the success they've had from it, but for me personally, I felt they changed directions from a small company supported by and beholden to their fans, to a corporate entity beholden to a higher power, not their fans. It isnt always a bad thing at all when that happens and is a natural progression typically, but to me personally, I felt like they lost something when they did that. I don't complain about it because I know its the way the world works and it has helped RT produce more shows, but I understand why some long term fans may still be bitter about the whole thing."
"Sure, if WWE was aimed at adults. But its not, its aimed at kids, weather people like it or not. They can't take a stand and talk about Benoit because kids just dont get that stuff. 

Dont give me the demo's I know the majority of the audience isnt kids, but when you watch the show you know its clearly aimed at them. You can't talk about a man killing his family because he was mentally fucked from wrestling. Kids wouldnt be able to distinugsh weather it was real or fake and thats dangerous.

I agree that WWE should own up to it and take a stand, but not on their T.V. or games or media that is aimed at kids. Which makes it very hard for them to be able to do it because kids can access so much now"
"Its a complicated thing. By not mentioning his name they have effectually killed his legacy, which is what they wanted, and what I believe should be done. Mentioning him by name in iconic moments allows him to live on and WWE simply dont want that. By not mentioning him, he effectually, never existed. 

On top of this new fans dont tend to notice these differences because they dont remember that Benoit was a survivor with Cena in 03, they only know what they've been told and shown.

Its not about Benoit wanting fame and WWE denying it, its about WWE making sure that Benoit is never looked up, never admired and never emulated again. And they do this by making it so he never existed."
"Only in the U.S, nearly every other Western nation, even ones with more relaxed gun laws, a young teenager owning and walking around with a gun wont fly."
"How do you use a flashlight in defense? Like shine it in the eyes of an attacker?"
"I believe the directors confirmed that it was Hep C, though I could be wrong on that."
"According to Punk, that Survivor Series did a really bad number apparently and WWE blamed Truth and Miz for it. I always thought that was part of the reason he stopped main-eventing"
"That 18 second match did more for Bryan's career than a longer match would have. Because it was so short, people were so pissed. The next night on RAW the crowd hijacked the show, booed the fuck out of Sheamus (a face) and chanted for D-Bry the whole night, It was pretty much the start of the yes movement.

If Bryan had lost to Sheamus in an 18 minute match the crowd would have been satisfied and wouldnt have done that.

edit: Im dumb and cant spell"
"America spends MORE GDP on healthcare than most Western nations, and in most of those nations, like Ireland and Australia, the tax rate isnt at 50%+, and in places that it is, it only effects the top 1-5% of the population, and benefits the other 95-99%.

But dont let facts get in the way of your ideology. Seriously, widen your view on the world and understand that these policies work in every Western nation and that the top 1% in the US have blinded the majority with fear tactics towards them."
"Yeah, it was a rare moment where WWE was actually in the right place at the right time to get a massive reaction, and Bret kinda just.......he didnt ruin it, but he probably didnt need to be there."
"I honestly think that the Cena feud did elevate Owens. Like compare him with Neville. Neville debuted and went into a feud with Barret. I think Neville won that feud, but it really didnt do anything for him. Compare that with Owens, who debuted against Cena and yeah he lost the feud, but he's been in the upper-midcard ever since and is now a Champion again.

I know that with Rusev it didnt work or Wyatt, but when creative has their shit together sometimes a feud with Cena can help cement guys in the WWE."
"11/11 is a military holiday in nearly every western nation on earth, it was the day WW1 ended. A war that England was actually substantially more effected by than the US.

Its not like its falling on the 4th of July."
"With Rollins injured the issue is actually a lack of a main event heel honestly."
"You know WWE book the battle Royal right? He won that because WWE wrote it for him to win it.

I'm not going to argue that he wasnt made cold on purpose, but the Battle royal as an example of him getting over is a really shit one."
"Yeah he did

He only hasnt got anything for the past few weeks because he was going to feud with Orton, who got injured.

I dont know where he's getting the Ambrose is given nothing thing from."
"It really wasn't. It didnt really become the weaker title till 2011/12."
"Undertaker also dropped the WHC to Jericho at the chamber for WM 26"
"Tuner felt like he owed a debt to WCW and thus didnt kick them off TV even when they were costing more than they were making.

Yes the merger killed WCW, but if it wasnt for Tuner, they would of been kicked of TV years before that."
"The young bucks did. They were approached by NXT, turned them down and just sign with ROH for much more money then NXT would off given them."
"Im not saying he was ear-marked as being the top guy, just that he was always booked to be in the upper-midcard being in the #2 or #3 position. Very similar to the way Ziggler is booked actually. An organic movement help push him to be the top guy, but WWE always gave him the opportunities to get into a position to be an upper-midcarder. It just took off a lot more than they thought it would but it wasnt all orgainic, it was a mix of WWE giving him oppotunies and D-Bry being so likable that it just took off."
"Daniel Bryan fought the WHC Jericho (back when the title actually meant something) to a competitive match in his debut. He was the only one of the NXT 8 to actually have a feud while in NXT that helped transition him to the main roster, with him winning the US title, YEARS before any of the other guys got near a singles championship. He was made MITB winner a few months after his debut, he was always keep relevant in story lines even when he wasnt being pushed (ironically his MITB few months were the ONLY time ever WWE didnt have him in a story).

Yes there was an organic movement behind him that pushed him to a top face, but he was always booked and given the opportunities to get over and he was always ear-marked to be the #2 or #3 in the company."
"Remember when Hornswoggle and Chavo had a feud that lasted 10 MONTHS and consisted entirely of home alone type pranks and Mark Henry squashing Chavo every now and again."
"In the shit, there was some really good hosts. 

William Shatner doing spoken word versions of wreslting entrances and that month where Randy would just come out and RKO the host ever week was good too. 

Overall though, it was so so shit. "
"It was a werid time because the Anonymous wasnt even a fucking heel. Like heels would feud with a laptop for months with no pay off what so ever. And then they turn Cole into the fucking heel that the laptop couldnt be. It was god-awful and a god-awfuly time to be a RAW fan. And you know the worst part?


They werent even lacking in authority figures! They fucking had Teddy long and Vickie on smackdown. BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME. Why didnt they just move one of them to raw?

The answer: Because fuck you heres Cole making fun of people who use the internet and the main villain is a laptop."
"Im not so sure he will ever get there now. If he never wrestles again, he'll be borderline. As others have said, he drew well at only a couple WCW PPV's, and TNA is well, TNA. It's PPV's never really drew all that well period when he was there. I know its not all about how much they draw, but it is part of the criteria that currently, Sting doesnt really meet."
"The concern is the democratic process, random chance is not democratic. Random chance should not trump what the people wish to have as a representative.

It does work in other countries, you know that right? 

Like this is a perfectly vaild and working system that works in other nations. Im not saying that you massively gerrymander the districts to reflect people wishes, just that little boxes grouped by postcode should not be the benchmark of democracy.


*Edit: I dont think I've explained myself well. The idea is that if a state has a population that is split 60/40 roughly, then the boundaries in the state should be drawn in such a  way to reflect this as best as possible. That way everyone has a district rep, as well as having an actual democratic system.  "
"If you have an area of 100 people that needs to be broken into 5 electoral districts then those 5 districts should be drawn in a way to reflect the way those 100 people vote. If 60 of them vote left and 40 vote right, the districts should be drawn in such a way that there are 3 reps from the left and 2 from the right. Just drawing districts without taking this into account can still result in under-representation or over representation of people through random chance. To make a district fair and democratic, voter attitudes must be talked into consideration when drawing boundaries."
"Have non-partisan groups draw the boundaries based on accurate reflections of voters attitudes like every other Democracy does and some US states do. It really isnt that complicated, just neither party wants that."
"It's just weird with RWBY though, which is clearly more aimed at the female demo. I think it just feels a little troubling when you hear they are now the male demo brand, but then their flagship animation is female centric. "
"He's trying to find it, You can't see me didnt happen over night. It takes a while to build and develop catchphrases."
"Yeah, thats a fair point. He hasnt had a good storyline since the shield broke up so its been really hard to be invested in him, I find personally. I was just commenting on how saying he sucks because of predictable booking is strange, because the top face has always had predictable booking. Sure everyone has opinions, but I've never really heard someone say they hated HBK because he always won, you know?"
"Stone Cold was the face of the company, Roman is being groomed to be the face of the company, thats were the comparison is coming from."
"Yeah, the biggest problem has been the storylines he has been involved in, not his booking."
"I see on this sub complaining about how predictable it is that Roman always wins. Austin nearly always won, HBK always won, Brett Hart always won. 

Its fine to say you dont like Roman because you dont think he's there yet, or his character isnt great or his feuds arent great. But dont try and blame it on ""predictable booking"", wrestling is all about the BABYFACE beating the HEEL, thats the point, thats the story. And if someone you liked was booked like Roman, you'd fucking love it."
"I understand what youre saying, but I think that he would need to be out of jobber territory before he could challenge. Otherwise he isnt a believable threat and it could bring down Del Rio having a feud with some jobber. That said I really hope he becomes part of this MExamerica storyline, but more in a side role."
"Normally they have like, qualifying matches to make it into MItB, this one they just said these guys are in it. No explanation, no storyline, nothing. Why was Neville in the match? Why only Kofi and not the other new day guys? 

Made no fucking sense. This is part of the reason Sheamus sucks as MITB because there was no story at all to him winning it in the first place. "
"Don't know why this is being downvoted. They have spent nearly a year now on building this belt up to being really prestigious. Even last week it was the US and IC champ in the 4 way #1 contenders match, meaning in Kayfabe these champions are just below the WWE one, which is a massive improvement from basically the last decade.

Swagger, who has been an actual jobber for the past year, wining the belt would destroy the work put into building it up. I'd rather Ambrose or Orton or Reigns, or Wyatt, or some guy who could use the belt to launch into the main-event, instead of Swagger using it to launch out of jobber status and into the already overblown upper-midcard."
"What is the cody rhodes character now though?

He isnt the Legacy son anymore, dashing or undashing anymore, he isnt a intellectual anymore. It would be an odd thing for Cody to come back, he would almost have to rebuild his gimmick from scratch because all his previous gimmicks have been circumstantial.

I'd be intrested to see it, but it could be quite a challenge to do."
"It all comes down to personal opinion. I personally think that ""industry changing"" is a bit much. Like it wont change what Japan, Mexcio or even other North American wrestling promotions do, or the way they book. If anything WWE was playing catch up to them for once.

It certainly changed the WWE though, and it was a great great match."
"Yeah it would,

I honestly cant remember if it was moonsault or some other flip type move if he was talking about. Either way it sounded really impressive "
"Dont mean to come across as a jerk, but how was ECW any good in 09? Christian was the only bright spot in a see of guys that just werent good enough for the main roster. ECW in 09 was so bad even compared to ECW before that, like no miz and morrison, no Kane, not even Teddy Long at that stage. "
"Show talked about it on Jerichos podcast, it was actually a really interesting listen. I think he mentioned how he did a sunset flip, or a moonsault or something of that description and when he went to the back he was blasted for it because it fucked up the giant gimmick and made it seem like in kayfabe he was impossible to beat."
"ISIS isnt a foreign invasion force. Its made of of Iraqi's, fighting in iraq. Yes there are other foreign groups with-in ISIS, just like there were some foreign forces in most civil wars from Ireland to Russia."
"I suggested that Cesaro shouldnt be the top face and instead would be a great upper-midcarder and I got downvoted to hell. 

I want want Cesaro to be revlent but people in this sub take it to the extreme where they want him to be THE top guy. "
"Its part of his Lunatic gimmick. Its the same reason Big Show didnt do overly athletic moves even though he could, it didnt fit with his giant gimmick."
"This is the strangest thing. People think that going away from PG would mean more blood and violence. It simply wouldnt. Chair shots to the head are banned because they fucking cause concussions, not PG. And blood, god, in every sport theres a blood rule where players have to be taken off and tapped if they're bleeding. I get that Wrestling is different, but I prefer the way it is now, with blood only appearing in very very big matches because it makes the match something bigger, something more. If there was blood more often it would get overexposed and its impact would be diminished."
"I agree with you, but most wrestlers arent being groomed to be the top face in the company. 

I think people just want something to be invested in the top guy, its hard to be invested in a guy who's fighting because he wants to win his match. Theres no struggle or intrigue in that. I know that sports are popular and revolve around this, but WWE isnt sport, and they actually have the ability to write a compelling reason to get behind someone. Im not saying every match has to be based on an epic feud, but more like ""I fighting to prove Im the very best"", or ""Im fighting cause I like to hurt people"". Just something simple that tells a story. "
"Yeah, especially the chair shots to the head. We know how much they fuck people up. They should be and are banned for a very very good reason."
"It was a different time though. A lot more companies let stuff slide back then. I imagen if WWE started using the word Fuck on PPV's some parent group would start an online petition to a toy company or something along those lines."
"I thought it only failed because Swagger was de-pushed after the pot thing?"
"Yeah, if he had ""broken"" cena's arm in the CAB, it could of been built as one of the strongest finishers. Drama would be built in all matches going forward as whenever Del rio locks on the CAB people tap as fast as they can so they dont end up like Cena.

Its just the match was good, but it ended strangely and I'm not sure it really put over Del Rio as much as when KO beat Cena clean or D-bry.

edit: I just thought of this. Del rio's face was clean shaven, which normally indicates a babyface. Maybe Del Rio is meant to be playing face and as such they dont want him doing a vicious heel thing on his night back?"
"Yeah, it was a weak feud because they knew Taker/Lesnar was going to be strong.

No use blowing a good feud if its going to be overshadowed anyway."
"Well it clear, what WWE need to fix the ratings problem is Trump on every segment "
"Im not saying he was pushed to the moon, just that Ziggler is an established upper-midcarder(i.e. the B+ player) who has main-evented before and that Rusev feuding with an established upper-midcarder, helps to solidify Rusev in or around the upper-midcard(i.e. a B+ player). Is he better than a B+ player, I dunno, but thats where he is and being a B+ player means he's in a better spot than about half the roster, maybe more. "
"Not really. I think WWE has many many problems. I just think that people complaining about Bray Wyatt or Rusev or whoever not being in the WHC picture and therefore they are being buried is silly. Wyatt is in a great spot on the card imo. Rusev could be used a little better but calling him B+ and that isnt a bad thing is accurate.  I find this sub overreacts to things, I admit sometimes I overreact back when people start using hyperbole though."
"How is he not currently at least #2? 

Owens may be the IC champ, but Wyatt is fighting the #2 and #3 babyfaces in the company. "
"Who would you say it is? 

You could argue Rollins, but he is actually someone who is booked like shit. He's won like 3 matches in 2 months or something. 


Bray is booked much stronger and as a much bigger threat. Hence Ambroses line about how it wasnt a fight it was war with the Wyatts "
"Fair enough, this sub just has this mentality that if they're not the face of the WWE they're being buried. I thought you were echoing the sentiment. I apologize if it seemed I went off at you, its just frustrating seeing it everywhere on the sub

I agree the feud has been bad. The writing, silliness of it and like Rusev, Lana and Dolph all had to leave for a time. And just when the feud started to pick up, bam, that TMZ article and it was dropped completely. So disappointing "
"His current gimmick is that he's ""WWE's resident superhero"" so the cape makes sense. I can see the getting rid of it if he turns heel or is given a altered gimmick "
"Rollin, Regins,Ambrose, Wyatt, Kane.

Seriously its not that hard to work out. Rusev is in a feud against Ziggler, a former world champion. He is consistently given a ton of tv time and plot. Yeah, you dont like the feud, but it doesnt mean WWE is burying him. On top of this Rusev has never, not once, been squashed or dominated in a match, ever. Theres not many people on the roaster you could say that about. 

Since the TMZ artical he has been buried, clearly. But up until 2 weeks ago, he was a B+ level talent. He wasnt a jobber like barret, or under a glass celling like Stardust. He just wasnt at the very top."
"I understand what you mean, but it wasnt enough change. He's still the same character he was in 2010. He didnt add anything to his character "
"Yeah, but since its rural and less people live there, the districts are larger and as such there as less districts. "
"The cigarettes are taxed directly, not a smoker seeking medical care. Its an important distinction to make, as I would argue that the cigarettes would be taxed regardless if the country had Universal healthcare or not, in the same way that most other luxury goods are taxed. Australia is particularly adverse to cigarettes and tax them with money going into PSA's against them and the such. This would still be in place even if Australia didnt have medicare. "
"Regarding your fear of government cracking down on unhealthy lifestyles, Universal Health-care has been around for decades in most other Western nations and there has never been a ""sin tax"" or any of the sort imposed on the people. A smoker is never refused medical care unless they stop smoking and they arent charged/taxed healthcare wise because of it."
"Bryan Wyatt is booked strong as fuck and has only lost feuds to Cena and Taker at mainia. Stop acting like WWE are burying the guy, at the moment he is probably the top heel in the company."
"Sounds about right, Punk was starting to get hot during and after his commentary run, when that ended he got the nexus......i think."
"Thats why Barrets there. He breaks physics and actually absorbs the loses from everyone in the match. He gained this mystical power shortly after wining king of the ring."
"The new nexus was the strangest group ever. I dont know how they formed or why and they then had one feud with Orton and that was it. It was the oddest thing really."
"I think this is the main thing. People forget that Sheamus has been around for a long while in the same spot on the card. And he hasnt changed much since he got there. Its why people are against him, he needs to change something majorly for fans to get behind him again."
"A lot of the stuff is banned for very good reasons. I cant see any of that stuff except maybe the word women, coming back."
"TLC is a little different, WWE actually own the rights to the name TLC and thus have to use it in a meaningful way to keep the trademark. A TLC PPV just solves lots of legal issues for them "
"What? 

Are you telling me Swerved and Jerry Springer cost $70,000,000 a month to make? "
"Fans dont seem to realise that WWE need 750,000 Network subs to break even after the launch year. They have over a million, they are doing quite well. 


Edit: I got my numbers wrong, break-even is 1.3million global subs, my bad."
"Laurinities was not HHH's lackey, he was working against him at every turn. And HHH came in when Punk was at his hottest like I said.


It really doesnt matter, HHH shouldnt have gone over Punk at that time, it killed Punks momentum and he never recovered. 

"
"But HHH wasnt the authority figure in the feud at all. John Laurenities was. He was always backing up VKM, he was the one who interfered in the MiTB match. HHH was only inserted into the story only after Punk became super over, and it seemed very necessary. HHH should of stayed in the office role, while Laurenities was the authority figure. He could of sent big heel after big heel at Punk, thats what they were fucking setting up for, then bamb, Its time to play the game.


What? HHH disappeared after Mania in March, wrestled at NOC in Sep, then dissapeared again until Mania in March. In what world is that not a long break? Fucking Bork wrestles more than that.


Sure it wasnt the plan, but its what ended up happening and it fucked Punk over, he was never that hot again and its the booking of that match that caused it."
"VKM retired the evil Mr Mcmahon character like 4 years ago. Hence no storyline around it

edit: Right, I should of been clearer, VKM has stated he does not wish to be an onscreen personality anymore."
"I think the thing is, people are bitter because HHH came out of semi-retirement, beat Punk, then went back into semi-retirement. It just didnt make much sense for HHH to even be wrestling, he had wrestled like 2 matches in the past year and a half prior to that punk match."
"Yeah, but if WWE make the stars above the company, it puts them at the mercy of the stars. The guys could demand more pay and better creative etc.....


Its shit that WWE do it, but from a business point, its what protects them most."
"On the Star wars Trailer and MNF note, Meltzer has mentioned that MNF was actually down from a couple weeks ago and that everyone switched to see the trailer is not an excuse as the MNF ratings did not reflect that."
"Seths new gimmick should be Big match seth


He only wins on PPV to retain the WHC 

/s"
"Bray only loses to the very top. Cena, Regins............who else did he lose too? Taker? 


Like the way some people on this sub go on about him, he sounds like a jobber, but he wins most of his feuds. So Cena and Taker beat him? Name one guy on the roaster that those guys havent beaten"
"In all fairness he hasnt really had a feud for like 2 months because of the Dusty classic and its kinda shown in the lack of story he has been given, hopefully he becomes more compelling now "
"Im not even too sure Orton would be, its hard to see him turning heel because he's one of the most over faces, and its hard to see them do a face Vs face, because the roaster actually has so many heels atm."
"Dont mean to be a downer but Cesaro was pinned cleanly in like 5 minutes by the Big show on Raw a couple weeks ago, he really hasnt been built up to be that believable threat, which sucks. WWE doesnt know what they have sometimes."
"Yeah, but he didnt win the belt and then he lost to cena twice after a establishment feud. If Cena's going away for the next couple of months then an NXT call up wouldnt have that oppotunity. It would be very strange for a relative unknown to beat cena for the belt and then not be able to have a feud with him. It would be jarring to the majority of the audience. I honestly would love for an NXT call up to take cena out in a squash match for the title, have a massive run and then meet cena for the title at Mania. I just dont think that thats what theyre going to do. I fully expect orton or Ambrose or some other near main-eventer to win the title on sunday. "
"yeah maybe. Honestly the Cena match is what has me pumped the most for Hell in a cell. Who will he face, the list seems really long or really short depending on what they want to do with the US title, and im pretty sure that this wasnt actually the plan. Like it felt they were building to Dolph Vs Cena, with Dolph winning by turning heel and then facing Rusev for the title, with summer as the guest ref. But then they shot that storyline cause of Rusevs engagement. So I dunno what they're going to do, which is great honestly."
"He's not booked for any events after Hell in a Cell, for about 6 weeks. You would assume that that means he's dropping the belt, but honestly with the WWE its not certain. They might keep it on him."
"Jericho's new gimmick is to always show up in mystery opponent matches."
"If Cena's losing the belt it doesnt make sense for an NXT call up to beat cena on debut, get the 2nd most prestiges belt in the company. It would be cool as fuck, but its incredibly unlikely."
"The 6 man-tag? He does 1/3rd the work in that match, its more 1.333 duty."
"Yeah, I could seem them having Dean and Roman as co-captians or something like that"
"Yep, when you compare the US to any other western nation, there centre left party is what every other nation would consider to be centre right, even a little right of that when compared with some European nations."
"How do you market that though?

Like this is a really interesting idea, but WWE and RAW is a worldwide show. You can't have Cesaro cutting promos in German while everyone else is speaking english, unless he has a manager translating like Rusev."
"The most watched non-PPV shows on the network are the Stone Cold podcasts. And its just not the guests thats the draw, its Austin too. Its why his podcasts are more watched than Jerichos. That alone makes him a lot more valuable than HH.


On top of that, he like, beat his wife and WWE dont really seem to give a shit about it, thus proving what they are willing to ignore."
"It sucks that this is a controversial comment on this sub, all you did was express an opinion and you've been downvoted."
"Makes me kinda worried at how much Sheamus is currently losing honestly. He's eaten the pin pretty often over the past month."
"Yeah
People seem to forget that ratings actually when fucking up when the brandsplit ended. With no brandsplit you can see the guys you like on every show "
"His promo levels need to be on par with Rollins or Cena or Kane or Heyman or Wyatt or even Regins to be a MAIN EVENTER. He could and should be the best wrestling upper-midcard babyface, who heels or other babyfaces beat or take to the limit in order to crack the main-event. He is not a main-eventer, claim weve never heard his promos go longer than 3 mintues is a cop-out, if his promos were on the same level as any of the main-eventers or near it he would be getting more promo time. They're not, package him as the best wrestler on the roaster who only the main-eventers can beat, but you cant carry a feud on wrestling alone."
"More people have more money and thus spend more money on things said corporation makes. So yes they pay more for work, but theoretically and practically in most circumstances, corporations make about the same."
"They tried to turn Ted at elimination chamber a month before maina, but the crowd didnt really get fully behind him and I think they gave up on the Raw after EC if my memories correct. I fully believe that the 3 way of Legacy at maina was planned to be Ted Vs Randy with cody as a guest ref or something. It really didnt feel like they were building to a 3 way at all, it felt like it was going to be Ted Vs Orton"
"Impressive

but how many times can you say cunt in a sentence?"
"No, Americans aren't battle-harded against snakes, spiders, crocodiles, platypi, drop-bears, Tony Abbot and the extreme heat to be honorary Aussie. "
"They actually talk about this in Punks Best in the world doc. WWE didnt think he came across as a credible threat against Taker, so told him to find some muscle to back him up and thus the SES was born from there."
"Yeah. The young star overcoming the veteran at Mainia is the final step in the build. They would put that in place and work backwards from there."
"I think you meant 6-man tag 30 minute ironman lumberjack match with an stop timer on a pole match"
"I'd rather they kill time by actually having plots and character development honestly. The wrestling is about the only thing RAW is doing right, its the stories and characters that suck."
"Punk was a caretaker champ and had really cooled off when Taker beat him. Plus it lead to a great time where DX and Jeri-sho, were all competing main-event tag-teams in the title picture with Taker and Cena"
"Yeah, they tried really hard to get Ted over and it just didnt really work. So instead they went with Orton. The whole thing really fucked over Rhodes though. He pretty much disappeared for a while after this and came back completely repackaged "
"I think OP might be talking about the splitting up of and ocupation of Germany also. If after the war America, France, UK and say Belgium, had broken up and occupied Germany like the allies did after WW2, Germany probably wouldnt of been able or have the motivation to go to war again"
"He stood out because he wrote his own promo's and was one of the few guys to be allowed to. 

Biggest issues with promos now is that they're written by creative and everyone reads from them, not many guys get to make their own."
"I believe he said himself that he was in a bad mental state, didnt tell anyone and was a dick to everyone because of it.

Like I completely understand what you're saying about the backstage shit, you hear the stories and it just sounds absurd why stuff happens. Drew is a bad example though."
"His debut was against the then WHC Chris Jericho, NXT was actually built around him, he was put with the Miz so he had a feud to go to after and during NXT (the only rookie to have a solid feud). He was given the US title months after being brought back, given MiTB like a year into the main roster. He always had storylines and was always around. He was never pushed to be the next top guy but fuck was he pushed to be the #2 or #3 guy."
"Teddy Long Smackdown was never really effected by an oppressive management storyline for about 3 years, same with ECW. During the RAW guest host era there was also no oppressive management, and the anon GM wasnt so much oppressive more of a dick who fucked with everyone. So like 2009-2011 RAW didnt really have the oppressive thing. Important to note that RAW sucked mostly during this era too, but mainly because fuck heel cole and fuck celebs "
"A Cruiserweight title would give Neville, the Luca Dragons, Stardust and most of the rest of the undercard something to feud over. 

In saying that the fact that they no longer have a WHC and instead its promoted more as the WWE title, makes a cruiserweight title seem out of place.

Maybe bring back like the european championship or something for the undercard to fight over, that or drop eiter the US or IC down to the undercard "
"Money?

Gimmick PPV's do very well due to the gimmick. Thats why they have them. Causal fans are more likely to buy Hell in a Cell because fuck yeah HIAC matches are cool. What casual fan is going to buy a PPV with a generic PPV name (i.e. Capitol punishment). It makes sense even if it hurts storylines.

With the advent of the network though, I hope this might change in the future as its not about selling individual PPV's "
"How the fuck was Owens fed to Cena. Owens feud with Cena elevated Owens from some NXT Rookie to upper-midcard heel in one fucking match. Then in the follow ups he beat the fuck out of Cena and kicked out of the AA from the second rope, NO ONE HAD DONE THAT BEFORE. They gave him fucking everything to establish him as a legit threat overnight. Cena's matches with Owens fucking elevated Owens. He's the IC champ for fucks sake, he was in the semi-main at Summerslam, his first summerslam he was even in. They lined up a feud for him to go straight into, then made him a champ.

Shit on what Cena did to Rusev and Wyatt because they were built up guys who Cena steamrolled, he didnt help them, Owens was different and you know it."
"In all fairness either Zigger or Lana havent been there for like half of it. 

Thats the thing with this story, Rusve broke his foot, then Ziggler had to film a movie, then Lana broke her wrist. There was like a month where everyone in this storyline was able to work and they spent that month building to a mixed tag. Lana broke her wrist so plans changed.

This has seriously been one of the most unluckly storylines all year, I feel they've been stuck trying to get a resolution for it for months now but havent been able to so they finally said fuck it."
"and every tag-team in TNA during the Russeo era

Tag-teams can't get along, ever."
"He's cheered because he's not around much. It's kinda like how Flair is the all time best heel but he will never be booed because of his legend status."
"Whats strange is that leading up to and directly after Summerslam this year WWE was considered to be pretty hot with a bright future. In 3 months its gone from being pretty hot to WWE is going to fail. Everything on this sub is a bit of an exaggerated view. 

Thats not saying there's nothing wrong. RAW's rating are down and people are souring on the product. But honestly a shake up at the top would do wonders, I think. It also looks like that shake up's coming at survivor series. People in this sub have no patience, they're clearing transitioning their top feuds at the moment, I wish people would give it time. I dont think people want WWE to fail because their fav's arent being pushed, I think people just want things to not get stale, i.e. things getting changed up every couple of months"
"Its also important to note that tone wise, WWE is in rebuilding phase atm. The roaster was pretty thin a couple years ago and WWE have been trying to rebuild the roaster up again. The re-build is becoming quite a success with the Roaster more stacked now than in the past 5 years. Seth Rollins appears to be the break out star of this re-build."
"Yes it was, for like hundreds of years it was part of the Russian empire, wasnt it?"
"Its good in theory. In practice it has given minor parties a lot of power, which some find better, some find worse. It really just stops a party that controls the lower house to pass any law they wont. They need to compromise to get through the senate."
"Tell that to John Gorton, Australia's only Senator to become PM. It's uncommon and its expected that the PM be in the lower house, but they dont actually have to be."
"Yep

The Australian Senate holds all the power of the lower house. They can create laws, pass laws, amend laws, defeat laws, the PM can actually come from the Senate. The only thing the Senate can't do is introduce a budget bill, but even then, they can defeat a budget bill.

The Australian Senate is pretty much on par with the lower house, unlike nearly every other nations."
"Senators. The senate is comprised of 75 members elected from the states and territories. 12 from each state and 2 from the territories. Due to the way the senate is elected (mostly proportionally) it is uncommon for any one party to have a majority. The leader of the governing party in the Senate is usually referred to the Government leader in the Senate. "
"Member for Parliament = MP

Australia has 2 houses of Parliament, lower(House of Representatives) and upper(Senate).

The lower house is made of 150 seats. The country is drawn into 150 different areas of equal population. Each area elects a Representatives (MP) to sit in the lower house. The person who controls a majority in the lower house is known as the Prime minister(PM) and is the head of government.

This is the federal level. 

On a state level, its pretty much the same, except the leader of the lower house is known as the State Premier.

The state of Victoria's Premier is the most progressive in the country.

"In all fairness it was getting a lot of negative attention before his video went up. People were disliking due to the over the top advertising.

I think you're right though, he shouldnt be airing it publicly. But in saying that, if they totally blew off his concerns then this might of been his only recourse for them to notice his concerns."
"A mixture of a horrid civil-war, the devastation of the purges and the failure of Stalins 5-year plans resulting in mass starvation. Also WW2 where Russia lost more men then every other country. 

Russia between 1915-1950's was bad "
"Simple. If you asked a random person of the street to draw what a wrestler looks like, they would draw Ryback.

He cant go 10 minutes in the ring or cut even a half-decent promo but he's jacked so he gets pushed. It's ridiculous "
"Though the match wasn't anything special, the year long build with the promo's leading into the match were actually incredibly good. And then it ended in a nice little swerve with the Rock actually going over."
"If they put Heyman and Paige together, it could inject a lot more interest in the Diva's revolution. People love Heyman, and him involved in the Diva's storyline, even if it hurts paige, could be a good thing as a whole."
"The coast is built up with multiple roads and highways and towns, no where else is really built up like that. It would be my guess thats why its blank there."
"Its disappointing seeing pixar doing 2/6 originals instead of the 50/50 split of originals to sequels they had previously promised.
 "
"It's weird that Inglorious Basterds is probably the worst named Tarantino film. Like Pulp Fiction, Django unchained, reservoir dogs, Jackie Brown even Kill Bill are good names. While Inglorious Basterds is just.....not  "
"They lose their momentum because of how Cena's booked. They lose the feud and lose their momentum. In that way it is a cause and effect thing, but youre right they could book a person as world champ afterwards. Like no one gains momentum after losing to Cena, thats my point. Like people lose to Taker at Wresltemaina and it helps them, or losing to Brock, or most heels actually. But with Cena they always lose momentum. "
"He beat the nexus in a 7-7 match, i believe it was only ever 2 against 1. Its shit that the nexus didnt go over, but it wasnt ever Cena Vs 7 guys, he nearly always had back-up in some form in that feud or used surprise attacks to gain an advantage on 1 or 2 people."
"Yeah, but he's the strongest booked man in the company, he can elevate people sometimes, see Owens, Punk in 2011, but mostly he destroys momentum, see Wyatt, Rusev and of course the nexus. Unless the person actually beats cena clean, its damaging to continually lose to him and it causes people to drop down the card after their feud with him, while he remains unaffected. Even when beaten cleanly he kind of turns it into a big joke, diminishing its value.

It's not his fault, its just the way his character is booked."
"Yeah, they're perfectly adequate superhero movies, not mindblowingly good, but good enough for what you're expecting. Sometimes you just wish they were different from each other and unique in a way. Its the same movie each time just set in different situations "
"Is it? I mean Russia and Germany also reverted after their revolutions, Spain too and you can't forget about italy. I believe if you look at the uprisings and attempted revolutions in Europe that occured during the 1800's you would see that Democracy's didnt last very long and were quite unstable. Honestly America is the outlier here in that it stayed a democracy after the revolution.Its really only since the mid to late 1900s since things became more stable in europe. Its important to not that many of these African and middle-eastern nations, have been nation states for less than a century. Their young counties and democracy does and has made them unstable because of it."
"Every country that was part of the Arab Spring has suffered from the Arab Winter. Its not that it didnt do anything, it did a lot, but there has been no stability with the changes"
"In all fairness they seem to be trying to recreate that situation at the moment by building up some guys.

Like Regins, Ambrose, Rollins, Wyatt, Owen, the new day to an extent. They're trying to build the guys up to a point where they could all be in the title scene along with Cena, Bork and Orton. Everyone else though seems to have been ditched, and I think theres a fear in this sub that WWE is going to fuck up with these new guys they're clearly building up, choose one of them and ditch the rest."
"Yep 100% I agree, the 3 hours is too long


But if you do the math you'll see why they'll never go back. With 3 hours, they make 1.5 times more in ad revenue than at 2 hours. So unless they lose over 1/3 of there total audience. i.e about 1.1million viewers in that final hour. They will still make more money than a 2 hour raw with substantially more viewers."
"So the Orton spot essentially. Can main-event when needed, then dropped down to the upper-midcard. Positioned in that werid spot between main-eventer and upper-midcard. A good position to be in, but I think most people feel Ambrose could be a lot more."
"The original idea was that the 3rd movie was never meant to be about Bane and was meant to build on the second movie. It was going to involve Riddler and Joker, but then Ledger died and plans changed. They couldnt have the joker anymore, so they shifted gears."
"Yeah, the comment makes it seem like Orton's some white-meat babyface. He isnt and never has been, he's portrayed as being a loner who fights people who piss him off, not some good guy face."
"Soccer and Cricket are the #1 and #2 most watched sports on earth. Ruby and Tennis, also invented by the English, are also widely watched. And England sucks at all of them. "
"Honestly I think its simply, Since Maina WWE has lacked a top-face. Cena's both booed and in the mid-card, and Regins's push was stopped. Since then we've had flavour of the month face's, Orton, Ambrose, Cena, Kane......until theres a solid top face I feel ratings will continue to fall.....Theres also the fact that most current feuds have been going on since just after Battleground "
"He was, at one point for a while. He was the upper-midcard heel. He's been in the business a long time, I think its all about cycles, one guy on top, then another, I think its just truths turn to be on the bottom atm. 

Plus personally I think Truth is a fucking fantastic comedic wrestler and he's found a good spot on the card "
"Yeah people seem to forget that apparently house show figures are on the up and the Cena Vs Owens house show match was actually a really big draw last quarter "
"nah he was in a fatal four way tag match with cena, DX and Jeri-sho in 09 or 10"
"I think its that TNA burnt people. Like lots of people have given TNA a chance, or even numerous chances only for it to burn them in the end with odd non-sensical booking. WWE does this too, but they do it less often than TNA and they have far more redeemable moments, hence WWE favours some good will and leeway. TNA has had less redeemable moments and more odd booking, and has thus, lost the goodwill that WWE can curry if they put out a bad show. "
"Your argument is that America has a lower standard of living due to a large percentage of the country living in poverty, cool. Excellent point. 11/10 "
"sure its complicated, but a reasonable minimum wage that tends to be on the high side leads to a better standard of living. And Australia has one of the highest standards of living in the world and 'Murica doesnt.

But thanks for keeping the oil flowin' though "
"The blood thing seems way too out there honestly, but in saying that so did the smoke baby monster. Im not sure why he's mentioned as much as he is. For me its one of the most intriguing things in the books is Benjen. Is he important or is he just a distraction. The fact that D&D keep bringing him up though leads me to think he is important in some role though"
"Australia has a large farming sector, food is relatively cheap. $2 a loaf of bread, $2 for 2L milk.

Sure games are expensive, around $89, but we get payed a lot more than $2.50, Minimum wage sits around $19-$22 an hour plus penalty rates when working weekends, plus overtime, plus loading bonuses plus mandatory 4 weeks of holiday along with something like 10 public holidays a year and we dont get shot for going to school.

But you'll ignore all that because it doesnt fit your narrative right?  "
"You've got to remember Star wars came out a long time ago, and less and less people have had that experience of flocking to see the movie. More and more people under the age of 21 have never seen star wars because it was never really relevant to them, and if you show them the original now they wont think ""wow how cool is this movie"" they think ""huh, this movies old"" and I think thats its this way on the list.

Try to look at it as a person who is sitting down and seeing all the movies on the list for the first time ever and then think about how'd you rate it. I bet a lot differently. Not everyone has had the same movie going experience as others but everyone gets a vote."
"Yeah, you're right, Benjens mentioned so much that it would be super anti-climatic if he's just dead or a wight.....

In saying that I wouldnt mind if he's just never found and it's always a mystery and that all the mentions of him is just a large red herring. It's always hard to tell with ASOIAF, weather its done for relevancy or to fuck with you"
"Cena still sells more simply because Cena has the most available to buy. Not saying someone else put in that position couldnt do the same, just saying just because it seems like the stuff isnt on the shelves doesnt mean they're selling better than someones whose stuff is. "
"And thats the real problem. Everytime tlow ratings get brought up people jump on the its because its PG thing. No, its because the show is overly long and mostly boring. I mean look at the current feuds. Nearly all of them have been going on for 3-4 months and it looks like they're going to continue for a while. Maybe thats the problem? not the lacking of death matches and swearing. "
"""A small group of people having control of a organisation or company.""

Thats the literal dictionary definition and is literally what OP is talking about, Im not sure you know what that word means. "
"yeah, they buried him in the most wacky way too, which helped fuel the idea that everyone knew he was good, but was being buried. Like he was 0-11 on NXT while everyone else was pretty even-stevens, but he would be the only one who wrestled the pros to competitive matches, even having a competitive match with the then WHC Jericho in his debut, yet he had the worst loss record. He was also the only real rookie to have a feud on NXT. Everyone else was just kinda there but he was fueding with the Miz and Cole. Which again helped him."
"Even that wasnt the massive turn....that was the great thing about punks turn, it was a slow burn, where he went from the Straight edge face to the Straight edge messiah. He justified his cash in for weeks and weeks before he snapped and lashed out, and then mid-way through the Hardy feud he embraced the hate. Honestly a good slow turn is usually the best."
"The book actually explains how all the time turners were destroyed the in Order of the Phoenix when theres that battle in the department of mysteries in the ministry "
"It really doesnt, at least in the countries I've lived in, maybe in American culture or at least some aspect of it, its considered negative, but I have literally never experienced this anywhere in Europe or Aus and remember that WWE is a global brand now. If its fine in the overwhelming majority of the global market then why would they change it to accommodate a cultural minority that fines it negative?"
"yeah but like.....that rumble still sucked though.....like even kofi's spot kinda sucked compared to what he had done before.....and kane and big show eliminating everyone did no one any favours. Not to mention the fact that there wasnt any real cool returning stars. Then show and Kane botched the spot where they turned on each other. Then the Bell ringer fucked up and rang the bell before the match was actually over (rusev was still on the outside) and then the Rock got booed. And the guy who had won had actually had an extremely quite rumble. Its not like Regins was the centre of that rumble at all, he was kind of just a guy for most of it, which again didnt help.

Even if you didnt like Bryan, fair enough, but the rumble match itself still was just so sucky."
"Nexus was the most dominate group in all of wrestling for a short while before LolCenawins. They gave the Nexus a lot in order to make them look like legit unstoppable heels overnight. Back then Raw was in desperate need of main event heels and Nexus was a heel making machine. Its so odd looking back and the Nexus and seeing where everyone ended up. The first guy to go became the biggest star while the leader became the biggest jobber."
"And still the newspaper headlines the next day would be sensationalist bullshit like "" Potassium find leads scientist to believe bananas once roamed free on Mars - NASA"" "
"yeah, I don't know whats going on, I was just commenting what was said on WO.

Maybe they wanted Joe in to train up the NXT guys and he was fine with being payed to mainly be a mentor? 

I mean 5 months in NXT for a veteran is pretty long considering Owens was I think NXT champ by then, or at least a contender."
"A wrestling Observer radio before NXT:Brooklyn. They where talking about how Soma Joe's first major feud was against Baron Corbin. How unexpected it was. Then Dave commented on how with his age and the time he's already had they arent planning on moving him past NXT.


Then again in a WO before NOC, they were discussing how Soma Joe could be the mystery man, but Dave said thats not the role they want him in, he was brought in for NXT only."
"And, you know, Dave Meltzer and Bryan Alveraz, the 2 most trusted sources in wrestling journalism.

But fuck smarks amiright?"
"And it looks cool to them? That plays a large part too.

Honestly why do you think the spinner belt was around so long? Because kids wanted a cool belt that spun.

And remember the hero doesnt always hold the belt. So suggesting that kids should want the belt of their heros is redundant when their hero might have never held the belt.

 The belts a butterfly because it appeals to little girls, thats a fact. Its a shitty shitty reality and I think they should change the design but dont try and deny that its this way for a business reason."
"Wasnt Goldberg considered to be a bad wrestler? 

Big Show wasnt a good wrestler when he was the top heel of WCW, even Andre wasnt a great wrestler. They were just big scary guys."
"Like?

Seriously this seems to be a common thought on this sub, that there was someone better than Jericho? 

WWE clearly wanted to make the Wyatts look strong going over Ambreigns and the mystery partner, but they didnt want to make Roman of Dean look weak. So the third man had to eat the pin.

Could you name a single wrestler who would of got as big a pop and would of eaten the pin?

Because I really can't"
"There are quite a few young people in the Basque region that were thought Spanish by a non-spanish basque speaker and as such find it quite difficult to hold a conversation in Spanish simply because theyve never been exposed to proper spanish.

"I think the original comment said person-for-person, if you go by that basis then I would argue you would count each persons accomplishments in general.

If you judge by how great the faction was and how much it achieved then yeah, you shouldnt count flairs prior accomplishments"
"Flair, one of the greats, 2 time WWE HOF inductee, on top for years

HHH, another great, again on top for years

Batista, on top for a couple of years

Orton, youngest ever champ, been an upper midcard-main eventer for a decade. 

Compare that to the shield now, not even close

I get that they're young but WWE has shown their hand, Reigns could be on top and have a good run, Rollins too, but are any of them going to match Flair? And its clear that WWE have no intentions of pushing Ambrose above the upper-midcard."
"Apparently the original name was Cezar, I think that was a fucking great name "
"Really? I feel the total opposite and thought the planet of the apes title hindered it. Previous from Rise there hadnt been a good or even anywhere near decent planet of the apes in decades and the Tim Burton one was so campy and goofy it nearly killed the credibility of the franchise to be serious. Just one mans opinion though. "
"Yeah, he said that he did it in order to continue to stay relevant, its seems to have worked"
"You're 100% right on that. Everyone quotes the old testaments weird shit and dont realise that Christians believe that Jesus's coming changed and reversed all that weird shit and it was part of the reasons he came."
"On Points 2,3 and 4, many secs of Christendom believe the bible, in its current form, to be the literal word of God and that God, through the writers, inspired the bible.

I understand that you're saying that the bible isnt acurate because of this this and this and that it looks more at culture and history than actual commandments.

But this argument simply doesnt take into account that many many Christian secs believe the bible to be the word of God, written by God, through the saints. "
"Yes it is?

Its part of the liturgy of the eucharist and the communion right. When the priest holds up the chalice and says ""do this in memory of me"" he is reading the right that changes the wine into what Catholics believe to be the blood of the covenant with Christ, thats why theres so much ceremony and kneeling. Its the reason the mass takes place on an Altar and the reason that you must of been to confession recently as well as being baptised in order to receive the wine.

Source: I'm a Catholic, that has been thought Catholic principles from numerous priests as well as Bishops as well as studying Papal encyclicals in catholic school"
"I mean, Catholics do believe that the wine isnt actually wine but is the literal blood of Christ

Edit: I meant during the Eurcharist, not having wine for dinner, should of made it clearer"
"But Romania is part of the EU and is expected to enter into the Schengen area at some point right? "
"In all fairness he is a producer for the show, and they tend to receive the Best show awards. That was the big joke the year Colbert won best variety and Jon steward kept the Emmy and his Emmy winning streak because, even though The Daily show didnt win, he was an executive producer for Colbert."
"Sure, but the primary security responsibility lies with the venue, not the WWE. To blame them for lack security when someone jumps a barricade at an arena isn't really fair. 

The WWE should expect the arena to provide sufficient security for their performers who are preforming in said arena  "
"Ok then,

Ill rephrase 

You're crazy if you think, after that HHH interview, that chyna will go into the hall of fame in 2016"
"HHH on the SCSA Podcast literally said chyna is never going in because of the porn thing"
"This, everyones going on about WWE security, but people seem to forget that security is nearly always an arena's responsibility. If someone jumps runs onto a football field during a game, no one blames the away team or their management for not having stopped it."
"The problem is Theon is really a secondary character before his ACOK so its hard for people to become invested in his story. Like its hard the best attached to a character that played such a small role in AGOT but is now a main one. Theres also a lot of new names/regions/families/sub-plots going on it that arc. So its a lot to absorb and Theons daddy issues just take a back seat."
"ITS A POLE ON A POLE SUUUPPPPERRR match, 4 times in a row, and they all end in swerve finishes and the game ends with snoop dogg coming out and becoming champion"
"Important to note that in the 1920's debt wasnt seen as being nearly as bad as it is today, thus the 1930's happened.

Also going back further, most people lived on small farms, like <90%, when living on a small farm, stress revolves around food. The weather wasnt as extreme and the farms werent as large, so growing enough food to eat was easier, people werent involved in politics or the news and life moved slower.


I don't know how stressful a person in the 1780s would feel compared to a person today"
"For that very reason. Everyone remembers them as this awesome group, they were never around long enough to get stale, it always felt like they're story was never really told to the end. So people always look back on them fondly. Honestly the shield break up seems to be one of the best booking things that the WWE has done in a while."
"They're closer to 15mins I think, the one against Sheamus was 17mins and it felt pretty typical.

Im not taking away from Cena at all, Im just saying he doesnt have to work as much as he did maybe 6 years ago"
"Its important to note that HBK hasnt cut a heel promo in like 15 years, apart from 1 in montreal 10 years ago.

Its a different era now and people always think that new is better."
"No superstars, Main event or Smackdown. He tends to work house shows and Raw. Also over the years he has gotten more promo time, which has lead to a decrease in actual match time...not much...but a little"
"He was pushed from the gate.

He was the main star of NXT for the first 2 weeks he was on, he even debuted against the then WHC Chris Jericho, back when the title still actually meant something, and it was a competitive match.

Like I'm not saying D-bry was ever groomed to be the face of the company, but he was picked to be quite a big star"
"How is that any different from a total brand split?

Like if the Sheild/Wyatts storyline is on smackdown only, why would the sheild or the wyatts be on RAW? Would they only appear in a meaningless match that had nothing to do with they're storyline on smackdown?"
"See Orton, he is always so crisp and fluid that sometimes it does take away from the match. It looks too easy for him, and not as impressive."
"We put them in camps outside the country, controlled by private security firms, that treat refugees and they're children as criminals, which is against the UNHCR, you realise that right?

"The current top feud is between Sting and Rollins about how great HHH is and how Rollins can't live up to him. HHH makes himself the centre of attention in nearly all major storyline's theres been since he's retired, from Punk to Bryan to Rollins, they all centre around HHH ."
"I would argue that john cena got a debut against Kurt angle due to his look, and Batista and the Rock were both meant to hold championships because of movie press so theres that too. But I understand what you mean, its never been as bad as having a person who can't actually wrestle being pushed. I was just pointing out that its wrong to claim that it is unique to the women of WWE and that it has for decades promoted people based on looks to some degree."
"Siberia, as far as I know, it was like the american wild west, only colder. With its own native population, and very little Russian influence.....other than....you know...the prisoner salt mines."
"He doesnt, thats what OP meant by WWE's shit. He comes in every now and again, but he hasnt been under contract with them for a while. "
"Wasn't there a whole thing here for the past 2 years about how WWE wasnt pushing d-Byran because he didn't have the ""look"". And then Regins was pushed because he did?

Its not model looks, but they are pushed based on body builder looks. A guy with those looks has to be just ok to stay in there position, while a guy who doesnt, has to prove himself over and over."
"Big Show is a veteran in the ring. Not saying he's an amazing worker, but its not like Regins was carrying that match himself."
"Even if its a reflex it still obstructed the ball and it could of hit the stumps.

Like its a shitty way to get out, but what do you do in that situation? "
"Yeah everyone has flaws, but not everyone is trying to become the face of a publicly traded company. The fact is, this stuff damages Seths ability to be a top face of the company. Roman (just as an example) does not have these negatives against his name, or if he does they havent come out. 

In this day and age, this stuff is damaging to the company and the people in it. In the 80's and 90's it didnt come out, so it was fine. Now it does and it looks bad. Just look at Hogan, guy has been a racist his whole life, but the public didnt know. As soon as it comes out, WWE have to cut him, or itll reflect badly on them.

"Cena debuted against Kurt Angle, he wasn't planned as the top guy, but he was planned to be near the top."
"The InterGalactic Championship?

The Belt would become a complete and utter joke, they've spent months trying to elevate the IC and US titles with former main-eventers holding the titles. Giving it to a wacky gimmick would kill it.

Edit: I'm not saying that it isnt a good idea, it would work well, but I'm just suggesting why it wouldn't happen atm"
"Its strange, because it all depends on when they plan on doing the Rollins Vs HHH match, which wont happen at the next maina as its rumoured its HHH/Rock. So either he turns and it happens at Survivor series or it happens at SummerSlam next year."
"Only if its the pre-show though, got to make room for that 10min Kid Rock song."
"An American R is restricted to 17+
An Australian MA is 15+ or have an adult present. They are not equivalent. 15-17 year olds could see Fury road. The Uk also rated the movie a 15+. This age group could not see the movie in America. Ratings work differently in other countries, amazing I know, its almost as if different cultures have different views on things.

I should also note that American ratings tend to be higher than most other countries in the West. Due to most Western nations having 15 or 16+ rating, instead of a 13+ one and then straight to 17+. Regardless Mad Max: Fury Road, was rated differently in different countries and the fact that it was an R in America does not impact the movie rating of other countries."
"Its not R in Australia? 

Each country has a different rating system, in some countries, like Australia, it is very very rear for a movie to get an R rating."
"Punk said they would add them into the new contracts to try and get him to resign"
"That was understandable at least, Taker did get a concussion like 5 minutes in"
"Not that I know of. Hardy has spoken on Punk though, saying he was disappointed Punk never thanked him for letting him go over in his retirement speech "
"But before the months before that he didnt? From Westlemaina to Summerslam, kane mostly cut promos and chokeslamed people, he wasnt in matches every week on Raw and Smackdown and PPV's. He did wrestle a single PPV match, he didnt really wrestle on Raw. He was in MiTB and took like 1 bump. Dude has a light wrestling schedule, which he deserves at his age "
"Heyman came out and said Ryback wasn't safe a while ago I believe"
