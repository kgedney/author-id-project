>In 1866, during the Thirty-ninth Congress, Bingham was appointed to a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction tasked with considering suffrage proposals.

Here's the critical part you're apparently missing 

>**Except for the addition of the first sentence of Section 1, which defined citizenship**, the amendment weathered the Senate debate without substantial change. The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868.


The first sentence is here: All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

Longer version, from the linked article 

>Burkman is well-known for peddling baseless conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Democratic aide Seth Rich and promoting bombshell information that never materializes. Last November — again at a Holiday Inn — Burkman sent reporters home without making good on what he had advertised as new allegations of sexual harassment against a member of Congress.

>Likewise, Wohl, a former hedge fund manager now banned from the financial industry, has amplified prominent conspiracy theories as a writer for The Gateway Pundit, an often-inaccurate right-wing website.

>The big problem in California, though, is not the stagnation of low incomes per se. It is stagnation relative to costs—in particular the cost of housing. As a rule of thumb, in rich countries household budgets come under strain once housing accounts for more than a third of income. California’s poor are far beyond that. According to the California Budget and Policy Centre, 56% of those living below twice the federal poverty line (that is, below $24,280 for one person) are spending more than half their income on housing. For recipients of food aid, the share is higher. Almost everyone at the Interfaith Food Centre tells the same sorry tale: after paying the rent, they have nothing left.

NeibuhrsWarning,"Sure. But Reddit likes to pretend the financial crisis was a unique burden hoisted almost solely on the backs of the young. The truth is, recessions hurt the entire working class and in different ways.  Reddit also doesn’t seem to realize: older workers ***also*** faced recessions earlier in their lives and in between.  Including many that entered into a challenging job market. We’ve had recessions stretch much longer than the one in 07-09 did. We’ve had modem recessions that sent unemployment higher too. Reddit either is ignorant of that or ignores it. 

I really have a hard time seeing why anyone would highlight this post. Recessions hit everyone. Those outside of the upper middle class and up are likely to be hurt most. Different age groups simply suffer in different ways.

I’m not arguing recessions don’t hurt the young. They hurt everyone, especially the working class.  But Millennials facing a downturn at the beginning of their careers isn’t exactly the unique trial Reddit likes to pretend it was. Gen X faced a terrible employment environment in the early 90’s (Bush’s “soft landing”). Boomers had recessions in the 70’s and 80’s that went on for years.

Bottom line is recessions suck for the entire working class no matter your age. The people that tend to weather them best are the upper middle class and the wealthy. The same people that have been doing lights out over the past few years. I don’t think older workers would argue recessions are exactly easy on the young.

In a 50+1 wins system like the US has, the 2 major party system is inevitable.  A party that can't get a plurality is a party that has 0 political power.   With the institutional tie-ins the big parties have, the infrastructure and such - a 3rd party from scratch has to build all this along with attracting votes.    
We've had one big successful 3rd party, the Republican party of the 1850s.  They ended up replacing another party and we went back to 2.   We've had several large platform realignments since then, with the modern day parties barely resembling any part of the platforms they held 100 years ago.

Being racist is not a sin if the theology isn’t emphasized- just like being gay is a sin because that scripture in the Old Testament is taught but tattoos and eating shellfish isn’t discussed although it’s in the same chapters.

He had some good runs but he did not look the same at all and pretty sure that last fumble was because he didn't have arm strength to hold the ball properly with pain he was obviously in all game.  Can't ask an opposing team to be nice to the running back and not hit him hard.  Made us look like assholes for hitting him, put him in position to get hurt much worse, and showed that Auburn had no confidence in their remaining players at the position. None of those things are good.

Senators can speak for as long as they want under normal circumstances, theoretically forever, and can hold up that floor vote indefinitely unless cut off by a vote of 60 senators.  This is why you keep hearing 60 votes are needed to pass something when a simple majority is truly the number, but in order to even get to a vote you need 60 senators to say ""Shut up and sit down"" for that to happen.

The Nuclear option is a simple rules change in the Senate that isn't restrained by the fillibuster and can be passed with a simple majority.

Nothing but complaints from everyone, both the hardcore AND the casual. It created a stagnate gameplay that continued unchanged for a year. It became boring for everyone involved.

Forsaken expansion comes out and they reduced the TTK again. Community and pro's came back. Game got fun again.

And finally, the Bill of Rights contains individual rights. All of them are individual rights. SCOTUS agrees. Even in Heller, the liberal justices who dissented at least all agreed that the right was an individual one.

So, in modern day, the Amendment would be written something like:

If Mueller indicts a sitting president, I have a feeling many of the Justices will have an issue with that as there is SCOTUS case precedent along with FBI precedent that says otherwise. But according to his written text along with his statement under oath during the hearing, he doesn't have an issue with the ability of Congress to remove a sitting president before an indictment.

It's super fucking clear in his testimony that he gave ALL the possible details without breaking nominee precedent of not discussing a current legal matter.

In addition, civil matters, also based on FBI precedent, that took place before the President was sworn in, should only take place after he is out of office.

nocomment_95,"I feel Trumpian is a few things intertwined.

1) it is the culmination of politicians not appearing responsive to the lower middle class white people. I say appear because appearance and pandering matter more than policy. Always have, always will. This is where the 'IDGAF if the world order burns down' attitude comes from. Not only have they been hurting, but they don't see the results of government (other than welfare/SS checks in the mail), so what does it matter if it burns down. 


2) take that hurt and give it a place to go. Immigrants line up perfectly. Immigration involves race without being explicitly about race. (They can hide behind it's not their skin color but their immigration status), it involves outsiders who hurt their job prospects, and aren't their neighbors (Trump supporters generally didn't live in diverse counties).

Look I am saying (and the stats back me up on this) suicide is a problem of access. If you are suicidal and hqve access to easy methods (doubly so for those that are harder to reverse like guns vs poisoning) the chance of both attempt and success go up.

I bring up guns because as far as methods go they are quite successful (unlike poisoning where you can get cold feet afterwards go to a hospital and have a chance to not die). Also they are easy to access. If we want to tackle suicide starting with the most effective methods is an effective strategy.

It is generally an impulse decision. They have found that putting mildly inconvenient but by no means insurmountable with a little determination barriers at popular suicide jump spots (bridges, cliffs etc.) has not only lowered suicide rates, at that spot, but in the region generally. It's not because people are simply moving to another suicide spot to jump, they just give up that day and go home, There is a good chance that they won't be iminantly suicidal the next day, and eventually get help.

Guns are basically the same as the unbarricaded bridge. Easy to get to and effective. Putting even a minor barrier between suicidal people and means can make a serious difference.

However, I still pay about 6k a year for the privilege of paying only $50 to see a primary care doctor instead of the $250 nominal fee. This is all because insurance forces hospitals to inflate 'nominal' pricing so that when insurance companies come in to get a discount, they still end up making money.

I wonder if this can all be fixed by passing a law forcing providers to charge uninsured patients the average of all the in network rates they have.

The issue IMO lies in how the north went about segregation. They didn't have the massive minority population like the south, so they used red lining, race riders on housing etc. to control where people lived, and then used the power of the state to fuel economic development to the white areas. This leads to a (broadly speaking) poor minority class and a well off white class. This allows future generations to see their racism not as racism, but as classisim, because they end up stereotyping black == poor.

nocomment_95,"Pro's some people can go to better schools.

Cons: I think people underestimate the fixed cost of schools.

The others only scale with large scale changes in student population. You aren't going to downsize your building by 1% if 1% of your students leave. 

What this means is that if $X goes to a public school per student. some large percent of that really covers fixed costs that don't change if that one student doesn't exist. Which means if you allow all $X to flow from public school to private school you are materially disadvantaging the public school.

It was big budget and led to other R & B and Hip-Hop videos getting big budgets and becoming short films. This was a really good video in keeping with the song.

ESPN makes money from ads and from cable rights fees. ABC only makes money from ads. 

College games are a different animal. ESPN/ABC has rights to more college games than they can broadcast so that’s why they are spread out.

Interpolation is mimicking the original song, where you use it as it was or change it up.

The sample was the use of the original melody from Pastime Paradise. The song is obviously built around this.

The interpolation is the use of the Pastime Paradise chorus. Stevie Wonder’s voice isn’t used. L.V. uses Wonder’s chorus lyric with a small change. If the whole song did this, it would be a cover. 

Then you have Coolio’s lyrics. They are original other than the use of a bible verse. The memorable parts of that song could be the hook and the beat, but Coolio’s verses are memorable too. And what really made the song big was promotion of the movie Dangerous Minds.

Personally, I think he isn't that good of an actor. He killed it in Ray, but he's still the dude from ""Booty Call.""

Cube didn’t call Dre soft and gay. Cube dissed Dre with sexual imagery to say Eazy & Heller were screwing him over businesswise. Cube also commented on the group using Michel’le (R & B singer) taking their street cred.

Dre wasn’t being called a crossdresser or bisexual by Cube or Eazy; but they did dis him over the stage clothes he wore with World Class Wrecking Cru,

I'm not quite as high on Captain Marvel as many on this sub. The cultural touchstone aspect has already passed. While Infinity War did tease her to bump the hype a bit, the fact that its basically a prequel will undoubtedly disappoint some folks who go in looking for an Infinity War tie-in.

1 - 6 are all consistently great and balanced the exquisite world building with character development and story telling.

Narratively, I've generally thought of Books 1-5 as one group since that is Rand's ""apprenticeship stage"" where he is still learning and this arc concludes with the scene at the docks.

So at the very least, those events have to play out like they did or the Federation probably gets destroyed. There are other smaller events that Voyager had a hand in that IMO Janeway would consider to be net positives that she would want to have preserved in the timeline (e.g Omega Directive, Unimatrix Zero).

There isn't even a novelty factor in being the first big time female comic book movie either overall or for the MCU. Also, since Black Widow doesn't even have powers, it's would basically be a spy thriller - something like *Salt 2* but with ScarJo instead of Angelina.

That leaves the Spurs fighting it out for the 8th seed at best, and many of their players like LMA, Manu, Parker, Gasol, Gay, etc. are all past their primes and will be another year older.

Trading Kawhi to the Lakers means you give the hypothetical Kawhi/LeBron/PG trio a few shots at the Warriors. But a few years later, LeBron will be pushing 40 and retiring. Kawhi and PG will be on the tail end of their careers. Right when the new crop of Spurs players start hitting their primes and perhaps championship window.


On the flip side, if the Spurs trade Kawhi to the Sixers or Celtics, then even if the Spurs successfully rebuild and make it to the Finals, they would be facing those teams with their current young stars (Simmons/Embiid/Tatum/etc.) in their prime along with veteran Kawhi.",nba,/r/nba/comments/8suxoq/shelburne_within_the_last_week_the_lakers/e12kkk9/,965,166

Humans can't survive long in vacuum, as the pressure differences would mean that you would pop like balloon. Your internal pressure is roughly equal to 1 Earth atmosphere (101.325 kpa or 14.7 psi). Since Leia didn't go pop, the only logical explanation is that she used the Force to exert pressure on her body - either directly on her skin or by compressing a small layer of air around her to simulate atmospheric pressure.

There is also the temperature differences. Space is something like -270 deg C so you would freeze to death really quickly. Thus, Leia would have had to generate heat somehow by using the Force to excite the molecules of her Body (or any air she held around her) to generate heat.

AndyChrono,"Yes there was, and a contingent of Star Wars fans threw an absolute nerd rage when it didn't even come close to topping Titanic. Titanic used to be comfortably in the IMDB Top 250 until around summer of 1999 (coincidence?) when those Star Wars fans started spamming it with 1 votes to tank its rating. Back then, IMDB wasn't as well known as it is today, so each individual vote had a relatively larger impact. Ironically, the vote brigading probably contributed to the rise in popularity for the website. At one point, Titanic went as low as 6.7 in the early 2000's. It has since recovered a full point to its current 7.8 rating. It's extremely rare for any movie to move up that much in rating so many years after release - usually movies tend to trend downwards and level off - it just goes to show how much of a dent the haters made back in those days.",boxoffice,/r/boxoffice/comments/89dn8h/to_those_who_followed_box_office_in_90s_did_there/dwqylmn/,856,160
AndyChrono,"The absolute fastest is the Icerail with full Freeze mods, but the drawback is that it requires you to be close range and it burns through mats like crazy. However I hate Scorchers too, so I don't really care that much about mats when fighting them - I just want them to die!

For all-around use, the War Bow with full Freeze mods will be the best since you can triple knock before opening up and instantly apply a very large amount of Freeze status. Plus, Bows have the best range of any of the weapons so you can apply Freeze from a safer distance. Note that if you are using the new TFW War Bow, you need to do a full draw for maximum effect.

The sling is frankly the worst of the 3 since not only is it pretty short range, but it doesn't apply status anywhere close to as quickly as the Icerail or War Bow. The only advantage of the Sling is that since the Bombs are AoE, you can possibly still apply status even if you miss your shot.",horizon,/r/horizon/comments/88r6t9/fastest_weapon_to_apply_freeze_effect/dwom58j/,940,182

AndyChrono,"Frostclaws aren't too bad. The fundamental principles behind killing them are the same as all other large machines: Inflict Freeze Status followed by massive DPS. Frostclaws actually help you out in this regard since they have 3 nice juicy frost sacs that you can pop to immediately apply Freeze status on them.

I have had good success using a burst damage weapon like a Tripleshot Sharpshot or even the Ice Cannon and pop one of those frost sacs as soon as possible. Once this happens, popping the other sacs becomes easier since they take more damage when Frozen. However often this is not even necessary. Once Frozen, the Rattler can melt them before the Freeze effect ends.",horizon,/r/horizon/comments/7f1i4h/frostclaw_frustration/dqa97ej/,678,116

AndyChrono,"There is a quest for the Icerail when you progress further into TFW. It freezes faster than Ice Arrows, but you can do the same strategy with Ice Arrows. The important part is just to get them Frozen so you can put the hurt on them.

For weapons I use Hunter Bow and Rattler 100% of the time. Fire is just too useful of a status since the damage over time effect lets you continue to do damage even when dodging. Rattler is my high DPS weapon. One of my other slots is always a weapon that can Freeze quickly, so either War Bow or Icerail. The last slot is my wild card slot where I swap depending on the situation - naturally for TFW with the high mobility of the machines, I opted for Ropecaster.

In your case, I would switch out either the Sharpshot Bow or Blast Sling for the Ropecaster. These two weapons accomplish more or less the same thing in providing high damage to Frozen targets. You don't really need both of them. Extra crowd control will help you out more IMO.
",horizon,/r/horizon/comments/7d6xwu/hzd_frozen_wilds_help_spoilers/dpxflyd/,978,184
AndyChrono,"I generally go with a strategy of:

1. Ropecaster to tie them down. That prevents them from endlessly zerging you.
2. Use the Icerail or Freeze Arrows to quickly Freeze them while they are downed by the Ropecaster.
3. Once they are Frozen, switch to Rattler and go to town.

If it's just a 1v1 then I can usually skip the Ropecaster part because I have plenty of room to dodge. However if you get aggro from other machines then the constant aggression from the Scorcher + other machines will make it extremely hard to find an opening.

This is the disc that plays most like a movie soundtrack and the tracks here are as good as anything you'll ever hear.

However, it was made with a modest budget and did manage to gross over 4x it's budget worldwide. That kind of smaller budget, high quality hit is something that the Academy can conceivably reward. While the Academy may like Villenueve, the fact remains that his film is going to lose the studio(s) like $100M this year and that's not something the industry is going to want to point to. Forget Villenueve, it would be particularly tragic if Deakins loses Cinematography yet again because of the financial albatross hanging over the film.

Funny enough, this problem might actually resolve itself bloodlessly if both seats are open. The liberal candidate declares for one of the seats while the more moderate Dem declares for the other seat. That avoids the nasty primary fight problem.

Once the GE rolls around, they can even coordinate campaign themes on common ground issues that both the liberal and moderate sides share (e.g. opposing Trump, saving SS/Medicare/Medicaid, climate change, etc.). Possibly even hitting some campaign spots together.

I do not want Lebron to get more rings than Kobe, even if 2 are in LA. I'm that petty.

He would have to beat the Warriors anyway. It's just that this way if he loses he doesn't get another NBA Finals loss. And if he does beat the Warriors and comes out of the West, it's pretty much an automatic Finals win against whatever trash team the East puts up *cough* Celtics *cough* plus the narrative of ""saving"" the NBA's best franchise.

That team would at least be somewhat competitive depending on the development of Ball and Ingram. More importantly though, the Warriors will start running into cap issues in after the 2018-2019 season where they will probably lose Klay or Durant to free agency. The current Warriors juggernaut was possible because of that Curry deal in 2013 when he was injured so they got to sign him for just 10 million a year or whatever at the time. With Curry having just gotten a huge payday, Klay, KD and Draymond are definitely going to look to cash in as well. It's very likely that the Warriors could lose 1 or 2 of their big 4, right as our young players start to hit their stride.

AndyChrono,"> Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that in recent years, superhero films tend to have audiences composing of 45-50% women.

That actually is not quite true. All data from Boxofficeguru.

* Guardians 2: 56% male
* Dr. Strange: 58% male
* Suicide Squad: 54% male
* Civil War: 59% male
* BvS: 62% male
* Ant-Man: 58% male
* Age of Ultron: 59% male
* Guardians 1: 55% male
* Amazing Spider-Man 2: 61% male
* Winter Soldier: 64% male
* Thor 2: 62% male
* Man of Steel: 56% male
* Iron Man 3: 61% male
* Amazing Spider-Man: 58% male
* Avengers: 61% male

The only ones that get around 45% women these days are the ensemble movies like Guardians 1 and 2 and Suicide Squad and it probably helps that these films have more comedic elements. All of the others skew around 60% men. There was only 1 comic book movie prior to WW has ever gotten 50% female and that was the first Spiderman way back in 2002.

AndyChrono,"I'm going to go big on this and say 835M.

It's on a relatively staggered international release with major markets like France (opening this week), as well as Germany, Spain, and Japan still to open. The fact that it opened at 228M globally WITHOUT those major markets is very impressive. Also of note is that it achieved around a 45/55 split on that opening weekend without those major foreign markets. So once those markets open, the split should increase in favor of the international side and should end up somewhere similar to Logan's 37/63 split.

IMO it finishes around 310M domestically [as I detailed in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/6g350n/will_wonder_womans_us_gross_beat_out_man_of_steel/din8um2/). Add in a similar DOM/INT split as Logan (37/63), that gets you around 835M.

AndyChrono,"All indications seem to be yes. It's going to be at around 147-148M after today at the end of its first full week. Even if you assume 50% week-to-week drops from now until the end of its run, that gets you to about 295M which beats Man of Steel. However I think it can even go higher than this because:

1. Audience response and WoM has been solid. The audience has also been skewing older and more female. That combination generally leads to stronger legs than your average blockbuster.

2. The Mummy looks like its going to be a total flop so there is no direct competition until Transformers hits on June 21. That gives it both this weekend and Father's Day weekend to rack up more business.

3. The last schools in the domestic market will finally be out in the coming weeks. This should improve the weekday grosses. Also, it does get 1 more holiday on the 4th of July for a last bit of wind in it's sails.

IMO it just barely gets the 3x multiplier for a 310M domestic final.",boxoffice,/r/boxoffice/comments/6g350n/will_wonder_womans_us_gross_beat_out_man_of_steel/din8um2/,980,180

AndyChrono,"I think it could get a 3x multiplier or higher and break 300M despite the competitive upcoming release schedule. The primary reason for this is that the film is skewing more towards a female audience for a comic book movie. Since it's not relying so heavily on the usual young male demographic for this kind of movie, that means it likely won't have its entire target audience stolen when The Mummy, Transformers, and even Spider-Man open trying to hit that same demographic later in its run.

This then leads to an epiphany of sorts from Luke that results in the line in the teaser for TLJ about the Jedi having to end.

The only way the Spurs win a game now is if LMA turns into 2003 Tim Duncan and Manu turns back the clock 10 years or so.

The more interesting thing for me is whether the 2001 Lakers' 15-1 Post-Season record might be seriously challenged.

Millennials, which made up the core of the disaffected, could be particularly screwed since if anything happens to RBG and/or Breyer they could be looking at a 6-3 or 7-2 conservative court from now until they retire.

AndyChrono,"Which Voyager?

* Stock Voyager vs Stock Defiant goes to the Defiant easily.
* On the flip side, ""Endgame"" Voyager with ablative armor and transphasic torpedoes would obviously win even more easily given the massive tech gap.

* The more interesting battle would be roughly Season 4-6 Voyager. The Defiant has superior conventional firepower, but Voyager does have Borg nanoprobe modified torpedoes, which could probably be reprogrammed from killing 8472 to disabling the Defiant instead. A single nanoprobe getting on board the Defiant means Voyager at the very least forces a draw. Voyager also has superior sensor range from their spiced up Astrometrics lab but this should be countered by the Defiant cloaking device. The Defiant should be able to take more punishment since its built for war.

Both coaches are also coaches that stress their ""system"" so that isn't the difference between them.

However Pjax is known for occasional use of a hands-off style where he will often let the team play through a slump instead of calling a time-out to fix things. Pop is notoriously hands-on, perhaps too much so.

AndyChrono,"Well, some possibilities:

1. Recast her. To put it succinctly - NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

2. CGI her. Ehhhh... maybe? It depends how big of a part of Leia has in the story. The RO stuff worked okay because they were relatively minor roles/scenes. If there are lots of scenes then the realism becomes harder and harder to maintain.

3. Write her out of the story. This would be awful IMO. Leia's character is one of a fighter. She would never just walk away unless the war was won.

4. Split her story between EP8 and EP9 to maximize the use of the scenes Carrie Fisher has already filmed. This is a tempting option but it does cause potential problems since Leia's arc might get stretched too thin.

Personally, I hope they go with a combination of #2 and #4. Split her story across the two remaining movies to make the most use of the scenes that are already filmed.

If he had outright accepted that Jyn was correct about Galen, then he wouldn't have had Galen in his sights at all and the whole team probably would have went out together for an extraction mission.

AndyChrono,"Well, the movie does answer the question since Cassian didn't take the shot and even tries to call off the X-Wing attack.

My take on it is this: IMO Cassian was initially leaning towards follow his Commanding Officer's orders to kill Galen. But then he sees the Empire wipe out Jedha and realizes that killing Galen now would not stop the Death Star since it was already complete. If he kills Galen then so what? The Empire still has a functional Death Star. In essence, the game had changed.

On the other hand, Jyn had told him about the transmission and potential weakness of the Death Star. Bringing Galen back for intelligence gathering purposes would probably be more valuable than straight up killing him. Even if Cassian didn't completely believe that Galen was on their side, he had to take a chance on it for the sake of the Rebellion.

""...only 37% of K-12 schools off yesterday, along with 76% colleges per ComScore, it was always expected that Rogue One‘s Monday would be off a bit from Sunday, especially with fewer kids on break at this point in time versus a year ago (73% K-12, 87% college).""

A difference of ~36% of K-12 and ~11% of colleges across NA is tens of millions of potential viewers (and their parents). $7.4m at todays average ticket prices ($8.61) is less than 1 million tickets which isn't out of the realm of possibility when considering the extra tens of millions of potential viewers.

You also don't have to pick someone who is 100% with you on every single policy. Obama picked Biden as his VP even though Biden voted for the Iraq War and Obama campaigned hard in 2008 (against Hillary for that matter) about how he voted against it.

For films like this, the quality of the movie doesn't make that much difference. A ""better"" movie than AoU would maybe add $50 million. Spiderman's effect will be minimal since the people that are going for Spiderman would already be predisposed to seeing CW anyway. That maybe adds $25 million. If you add that to AoU domestic gross and some ticket price increases, you're looking at roughly 550m domestic.

Internationally, expect it to basically play exactly like AoU. I wouldn't count on China providing a monster gross since the name of the movie is ""Captain America"".

Bernie should win Massachusetts and his home state Vermont.

American Samoa, Minnesota and Colorado will basically be a wash.

Overall because of her dominance in the more populous states like Texas, Georgia, and Virginia, I think Clinton should walk away with about ~55% of the 865 delegates in play so that's roughly a net gain of 86 delegates.

For instance, the #1 donor Citigroup? Of the total 824k in donations, 816k (or 99% if you prefer to think of it that way) came from individuals. That means it's basically employees that work for that company making individual donations to her. NOT the company plopping down 800k+ like the BernieBros would have you believe.

The same trend holds true for the rest of her major donors on that list. ~99% of those amounts are individual donations from people working at those organizations.

Bernie's only real path to the nomination was to take both Iowa and NH which are 90%+ white and use the media cycles to generate momentum to take into Nevada.

Without winning Iowa, a Bernie victory in NH would likely be written off as a neighbor state effect with very favorable demographics. Splitting the first two states going into Nevada will probably mean that Nevada won't change the race much. I think Nevada will probably go Clinton in this situation; the best Bernie could hope for in Nevada would be another 50/50 wash like in Iowa.

I'll explain it to you. This first part refers to some group of people that Mexico sends. This group of people, being sent, are not the best Mexico can send. That means there are other people in Mexico, not being sent to the US. We therefore have two categories: people in Mexico, and the people Mexico sends. 

Trump then goes on to describe the people being sent. This is one category. He mentions them as bringing crime, rapists etc. These characteristics are used to describe the people being sent. These characteristics are not used to describe mexicans in mexico.

A lot of players need off the court bonding to create that chemistry, and they become skeptical of players who then shy from those social arenas. 

I see it as this: in all social settings, there is a tension between the individual and the group. To fit in, you have to sacrifice and adapt a bit as an individual. If the Cavs is a very social and extrovert group, then Love has to adapt. He can't expect everyone else to adapt.

And before people accuse me of being ""alt right"", both sides do this.

Over the last few years, through deep market analysis, ethnographic study, and highly advanced acoustic research, we have come to scientifically prove that the player community prefers games with titles that form the following acronym: HotS. We were amazed. It’s quite unexpected. For some reason, people just synergize with the acronym HotS. In one study, 87% of respondents choose the HotS acronym over another random video game acronym. People seem to like how easy it is to say, how attractive they feel when saying it, and the sudden rise in body temperature associated with such an impactful acronym. Other than that, it’s baffling, but it’s awesome at the same time!”

The physical strength of men and their increased aggression certainly increased the likelihood that they were dominant, but it was by no means uniform.

You do you, but most people don’t accomplish much by hating themselves. A lot of obese people got that way with the help of an underlying trauma or mental health issue. If that’s not addressed, weight loss will not stick. Because the problem wasn’t fixed just by losing the weight. Hating ourselves is how this happens in the first place and it leads to reinforcement of self destructive habits.

Looking back, I'm glad they decided on small acknowledgements instead of a special episode. I don't see how wearing FDNY shirts and seeing some more flags around that time is creepy. It was a way to acknowledge what was happening and solidarity with the rest of the country that's hurting without making the whole show about it.

This is the only thing I was like ""nah"" about on your end. 

There are valid points to be made about gender specific items marketed towards kids. Like how Hasbro had to be told multiple times to include the female main characters from Star Wars in their toys because they assumed ""boys wouldn't want"" women action figures. Or how until a few years ago, there were very few Star Wars/Superhero shirts marketed towards girls and every single one that did exist was light pink. 

However, I think your sister is going a bit overboard and neither of those gifts sound gender specific at all. It's not like you got her a baby doll and him a toy gun. It's sweet that you got them gifts. Maybe to avoid this in the future for their birthdays, just take the two of them to target or whatever and let them pick one (reasonably priced) toy of their own liking.

Legally sane people choose to hate so much that they murder others all of the time. They understand what they are doing is wrong. They understand that they are murdering people. They are sane enough to devise plans to do so. The fixation on insisting that someone has to be mentally ill to murder someone is stopping actual solutions. The quicker people accept that this is a *decision* that people are making and not blaming it on mental illness, the quicker we can make actual strides in addressing the issue.

I wonder how weird it is for that group of people that their camp memories are shared with thousands of people in a certain age range. 

As far as a reboot of sorts, I saw that they are going to be 10-12 year olds. I guess that is their demographic now but what drama could 10 years olds possibly have to fuel a show. 13-14 is right on that cusp of trying to figure things out for yourself and first major crushes and things like that, which is a reason I think the OG Bug Juice worked. I just hope it isn't super contrived and over the top like Disney Channel has grown to be. ",television,/r/television/comments/6rly8x/disney_channel_is_reviving_90s_campset_show_bug/dlnao2d/,963,194

This isn't Zdarsky's universe. That isn't to say that I don't understand why people want that representation. Of course.

There have been many adaptions--some of them even had him married, a lot of had him have a soft spot for Betty. This is just his adaptation of Jug.

Any time they got back together it was a mess. Yes, she was in denial about what a break meant which wasn't helped by the fact that they didn't talk about it before he left. He couldn't see it from her point of view, about exactly how hurt she was that he slept with the chick hours later and then lied about it. Neither was entirely wrong, neither was entirely right.

That's why 2020 is probably going to look a lot more like the Evers/Walker race....  Certain candidates might make the margin a little bigger but i don't think even Klobucher will win PA by larger than 2-3%(probably will run away with MN tho)...

>Here’s the problem. A guy with Ayton’s incredible physical tools should block a lot of shots, and he just doesn’t. He’s much bigger and longer than the vast majority of the players he faces in college. If he just stands in front of the rim and waves his arms around, he should block shots by osmosis alone. It’s concerning, because centers who don’t block shots in college have not fared well in the NBA. Ayton is blocking shots at a historically low rate for a future lottery pick. There have been 17 NCAA centers drafted in the top 10 since 2010, and Ayton’s freshman year block rate is tied with Cody Zeller’s for second-lowest among the players in that group.

djphan,"is there a compelling argument against that there won't be a cut to entitlements?  i don't think it's fair to dismiss or handwave the analysis due to 'hypotheticals'....  the argument against is that basically the tax cuts will pay for itself....  do you think that's correct?  

i don't agree with this whole false equivalence/blurring the lines argument.... republicans are saying that the analysis is false because it will pay for itself.... another side is saying there's no free lunch.... it's fairly easy to see who has a more compelling argument in this case...  

and it's because of that i don't think the vox article was too far off... they chose a more literal summary from the tax policy center which was actually more faithful....  if you had a problem with vox... you have a problem with the tax policy center analysis....

the cinemascore came out ok... it's online polling that's showing a polarized audience.... which sort of points to ppl manipulating the score... and if you look on reddit.. the ppl critical of it spend an incredible amount of effort doing so....

if you don't like it that's fine... but there are ppl who disagree and it offends some ppl to the point of psycopathy..

most ppl disagree with you.... despite your enormous efforts to convince ppl otherwise.... it's still gonna make a shitload of money...  

i was the same way during TFA... and while i didn't like TLJ... some of the shit ppl are throwing it's way is out of bounds... so no there's no cognitive dissonance.... i think after you mature a little bit you'll come to the same conclusion eventually....

i've already added my piece when i went to go see it opening night....  i've been looking at what's happening over the internet and i came into this thread to search out what's actually happening...

cinemascore is real ppl polling.... and it came out fine....  the box office is real ppl giving their money for it and it also has come out fine... 

no it's not a perfect movie... but it's no worse than TFA or R1... i didn't like any of them but i also don't think it was worse than the prequels or the DC movies which is how some ppl think it is...  

it is outrageous and there's def fishiness going on... i trust the critics more than online polling.. esp the trolls over at imdb.... ",movies,/r/movies/comments/7jwxnd/official_discussion_star_wars_episode_viii_the/drokr4j/,672,129
